IzPack Readme
=============

IzPack is a one-stop solution for packaging, distributing and deploying
applications.

It is fully cross-platform and generates a single installer. As such,
it is an alternative to native solutions such as platform-specific 
installers and package managers.

IzPack-generated installers only require a Java virtual machine to run.
It is however capable of providing integration with the host operating
systems (e.g., creating desktop shortcuts or editing the Windows registry).

Licensing
=========

IzPack is published under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0, 
meaning that you can adapt it to your needs with very minimal constraints.

Some third-party components (e.g., look and feel libraries) may be released
under different terms.
