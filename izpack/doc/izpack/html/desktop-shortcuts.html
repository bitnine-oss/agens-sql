<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Defining Shortcuts</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>On todays GUI oriented operating systems, users are used to launching
applications, view web sites, look at documentation and perform a variety of
other tasks, by simply clicking on an icon on the desktop or in a menu system
located on the desktop. Depending on the operating system these icons have
different names. In this context we will refer to them collectively as
shortcuts.</p>
<p>Apart from actually placing an application on the target system, users
routinely expect an installer to create the necessary shortcuts for the
application as well. For you as application developer, this means that for a
professional appearance of your product you should also consider creating
shortcuts.</p>
<p>In contrast to the general specification of an IzPack installer, the
specification of shortcuts in IzPack requires a little more effort. In
addition, some of the concepts are a bit more complex and there are some
operating system specific issues to observe. Fortunately, you only need to
worry about operating system specifics if you want to deploy your application
to multiple different operating systems. In any case, it will pay off to
spend some time to study this documentation and the example spec files before
you start to implement your own shortcuts.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this Chapter the current IzPack Version 3.7.0-M3 is
only capable to creating shortcuts on</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Microsoft Windows, and</li>
<li>Unix and Unix-based operating systems (like Linux), which use the
<cite>X11</cite> GUI-System and ` FreeDesktop.org` based shortcut handling (such
as <cite>KDE</cite> and <cite>Gnome</cite>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Other operating or GUI systems, such as MacOS X are not
supported. However, there is a special UI-variant that automatically pops up
on unsupported systems. It informs the user about the intended targets of
your shortcuts and allows the user to save this information to a text file.
While this is not an elegant solution, at least it aids the user in the
manual creation of the shortcuts.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">There is no support from the IzPack project of this feature
for Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows ME.
Please check the patches at <a class="reference external" href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/IZPACK-58">http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/IZPACK-58</a>
if you need to support those platforms.</p>
</div>
<p>If you would like to review what an end user would see if the target
operating system is not supported, you can do the following. Simply place the
tag <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;notSupported/&gt;</tt> in the spec file. This tag requires no attributes or
other data. It must be placed under <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;shortcuts&gt;</tt>, just like the individual
shortcut specifications. Be sure to remove this tag before getting your
application ready for shipment.</p>
<p>We expect other operating systems to be supported in the near future and as
always, contributions are very welcome. At present someone is actively
working on Mac support.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-to-add-to-the-installer">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">What to Add to the Installer</a></h2>
<p>There are some things that you have to add to your installer to enable
shortcut creation. Obviously you need to add the panel responsible for
creating shortcuts. This panel is aptly enough called ShortcutPanel. However,
in order for the ShortcutPanel to work properly a number of additional items
are required. These must be added manually to the installer, as all other
resourcs, since the front-end will be rewritten. In this chapter we will
explain which of these items are required and for what reason.</p>
<p>First, we would like to discuss items that are supplied with IzPack and only
need to be added to the installer. After that, we move on to the things you
have to prepare yourself before you can add them. The way in which shortcuts
are created varies widely among operating systems. In some cases it is
possible to do this with pure Java code, while other systems -such as MS-
Windows- require native code to accomplish this task. On the other side, the
current implementation, which creates shortcuts on Unix based systems needs
no native library at all, since it works with 'these' pure Java code. The
native library required for the Windows operating systems are supplied with
IzPack is called <tt class="docutils literal">ShellLink.dll</tt>. Note: They will not be automatically
added to your installer file. You need to list them yourself in the XML file
for the installer. A describtion how to do this follows in the next section.</p>
<p>Native libraries can be added to the installer by using the <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;native&gt;</tt> tag.
To add the <tt class="docutils literal">ShellLink.dll</tt>, you just have to add the following line to the
installer XML file:
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;native <span class="pre">type=&quot;izpack&quot;</span> <span class="pre">name=&quot;ShellLink.dll&quot;/&gt;</span></tt>
For more details about the use of the <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;native&gt;</tt> tag see the chapter about
the format of the XML file.</p>
<p>You have also to add an extra specification file for each platform family to
enable shortcut creation on these platforms. At least one (the default file)
is required by the shortcut panel. The format of all spec files is XML and
they must be added to the installer as a resource. The source name of this
specification does not matter, however its resource name (also called id or
alias) when added to the installer must be <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(prefix)+shortcutSpec.xml</span></tt>.
At this release, there are only two prefixes supported: &quot;Win&quot; for the
Windows family and &quot;Unix&quot; for all Unixes. If the prefix is ommited the
shortcut panel searches for a named resource: `` shortcutSpec.xml``. This is
the default resource name. As the default resource name will be used on
Windows platforms, the <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;Win_shortcutSpec.xml&quot;</tt> can be ommited.
Hint: If the shortcut panel does not find one of these named resources, it
will never appears. So, do not use different resource names and do not add a
path to these.</p>
<p>ShortcutSpecs can be localized, see &quot;Localizing shortcuts&quot; below.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;res src=&quot;C:\MyDocuments\Installer\default_shortcut_specification.xml&quot;
     id=&quot;shortcutSpec.xml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;res src=&quot;C:\MyDocuments\Installer\unix_shortcut_specification.xml&quot;
     id=&quot;Unix_shortcutSpec.xml&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
<p>Why use different shortcut spec files?</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The Target filenames are most different.(batch files on Windows vs.
shell scripts on Unix.)</li>
<li>The Icon file formats are different. ICOs on Windows-, PNGs on Unix-
platforms.</li>
<li>The Target locations can be different.</li>
<li>If your installer is localized, your users sure will expect their
shortcuts names and descriptions to be as well. Moreover, some paths
can be different when OS are localized (<tt class="docutils literal">My Documents</tt> becomes
<tt class="docutils literal">Mes Documents</tt> on Windows in french for example). See &quot;Localizing
shortcuts&quot; below.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the simple reason.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Why Native Code to do the Job on Windows?</a></h1>
<p>by Elmar</p>
<p>This little chapter is not strictly part of the documentation but i have been
asked this question sufficiently often that i think it's worth explaining
right here. It is certainly a natural question to ask. After all IzPack is an
application completely written in Java and primarily targeted for the
installation of Java based programs. So why wouldn't we try to keep
everything pure Java and avoid the use of native code altogether? There must
be some personal preference of the developer hidden behind this approach you
might think. Well, not really, but i admit at first it seems quite feasible
to write it all in Java. On virtually any operating system or GUI surface
around, Shortcuts are simply files on the local file system. Files can be
created and accessed directly from within Java, so why should there be a need
for using native code?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that just creating a file is not good enough, it also
needs to have the right content. Shell Links as they are called in Windows
land are binary files. i actually managed to find documentation on the
format. Naturally this was hacker data, you won't get this sort of thing from
Microsoft (by the way: thanks a lot to Jesse Hager for a smash job!). Armed
with this information i tried to create these files myself in Java. The
problem was that the documentation was not entirely accurate and had some
gaps as well. i tried for over a month to get this to work but finally i had
to give up. Even if i would have succeeded, it would have been a hack, since
a shell link requires some information that is impossible to obtain from
within Java. Usually you can successfully create a shell link by only filling
in the bare minimum information and then ask Windows to resolve the link.
Windows then repairs the shell link. Unfortunately this was only the
beginning, soon i encountered a host of other problems. For one thing, the
installer needs to know the correct directories for placing the links and it
turns out they are named differently in different countries. In addition,
there are ways of manually modifying them, which some people might actually
have done. The only way to place the shortcut files reliably is through
accessing the Windows Registry. Naturally, this operation also required
native code. Same thing with asking Windows to resolve the link... On the
bottom line, at every step and turn you run into an issue where you just need
to use native code to do the trick. So i decided that i would do it the
proper way all the way through. That is in a nutshell the reason why i used
native code to create shortcuts on MS-Windows.</p>
<p>As i am writing this i am at work with a friend to replicate this work for
the Mac and it looks very much like we need to take the same approach there
as well. On the various Unix GUIs on the other hand, we are lucky that we can
do the job without native libraries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-shortcut-specification">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">The Shortcut Specification</a></h1>
<p>As we say above, the specification for shortcuts is provided to the
ShortcutPanel in the XML fileformat. At the time of this writing (for IzPack
version 3.7.0-M3) the front-end will be rewritten. Until these work is in
progress you have to write the specification files manually. For your
convenience, there are two annotated sample specification files in the sample
subdirectory of your IzPack installation. At the beginning you might want to
experiment with these files.</p>
<p>Both specification files have one root element called <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;shortcuts&gt;</tt>. This
root elements recognizes 3 different child elements:
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;programGroup&gt;</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;skipIfNotSupported/&gt;</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;defaultCurrentUser/&gt;</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;shortcut&gt;</tt>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">&lt;skipIfNotSupported/&gt;</tt> can be used to avoid the panel to show the
alternative UI which shows the shortcut information that would have been
created on a system that supports it. In other words, using this tag will
make the panel be silent on non-supported systems. The default is to show the
alternative UI.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">&lt;defaultCurrentUser/&gt;</tt> may be specified to make &quot;current user&quot; be the default selection on the panel.
If not specified then &quot;all users&quot; will be the default selection (if available).</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;programGroup&gt;</tt> tag allows you to specify the name of the menu, or
more precise, the folder in which the shortcuts will be grouped. The exact
location and appearance of the program group depends on the specific target
system on which the application will be installed, however you can partially
control it. Please note that <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;programGroup&gt;</tt> may only appear once in the
specification. If more than one instance occurs, only the first one will be
used. This tag requires two attributes: <tt class="docutils literal">defaultName</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">location</tt>.
<tt class="docutils literal">defaultName</tt> specifies the name that the group menu should have on the
target system. You should be aware that the ShortcutPanel will present this
name to the user as a choice. The user can then edit this name or select a
group that already exists. As a result, there is no guarantee that the actual
name of the program group on the target system is identical with your
specification. <tt class="docutils literal">location</tt> specifies where the group menu should show up.
There are two choices: <tt class="docutils literal">applications</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">startMenu</tt>. If you use
<tt class="docutils literal">applications</tt>, then the menu will be placed in the menu that is ordinarily
used for application shortcuts. <tt class="docutils literal">applications</tt> is recommended for Unix
shortcuts. If you use <tt class="docutils literal">startMenu</tt>, the group menu will be placed at the top
most menu level available on the target system. Depending on the target
system, it might not be possible to honor this specification exactly. In such
cases, the ShortcutPanel will map the choice to the location that most
closely resembles your choice. Unix shortcuts do not need to support the
<tt class="docutils literal">startMenu</tt>, because the <tt class="docutils literal">applications</tt> menu is already on the highest
level. This means this has no affect on thess platform.</p>
<p>For each shortcut you want to create, you have to add one <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;shortcut&gt;</tt> tag.
Most details about the shortcut are listed as attributes with this tag. The
following sections describe what each attribute does, which attributes are
optional and which ones are required and what the values are that are
accepted for each of the attributes. Note that all attributes that have a
yes/no choice can also be omitted. Doing so has the same effect as using a
value of no. The shortcut attributes can be divided into two groups</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>attributes that describe properties of the shortcut</li>
<li>attributes that define the location(s) at which a copy of the
shortcut should be placed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following attributes are used to define location:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">programGroup</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">desktop</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">applications</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">startMenu</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">startup</tt></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shortcut-attributes">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Shortcut Attributes</a></h1>
<p>There are three classes of attributes. Some are required, most are completely
optional and some are semi-optional. The set of semi-optional attributes are
all the attributes used to define the location of a shortcut. These are semi-
optional because for any individual one it is your choice if you want to
include it or not. However they are not completely optional. You must specify
at least one location. If all were omitted, the instruction would essentially
tell the panel that a copy of this shortcut is to be placed at no location.
In other words no copy is to be placed anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>name</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- required</tt></p>
<p>The value of this attribute defines the name that the shortcut will have.
This is the text that makes up the menu name if the shortcut is placed in a
menu or the caption that is displayed with the shortcut if it is placed on
the desktop.</p>
<p><strong>target</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- required</tt></p>
<p>The value of this attribute points to the application that should be launched
when the shortcut is clicked. The value is translated through the variable
substitutor. Therefore variables such as <tt class="docutils literal">$INSTALL_PATH</tt> can be used to
describe the location. <strong>You should be aware that the use of this tag is
likely to change once other operating systems are supported</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>commandLine</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- optional</tt></p>
<p>The value of this attribute will be passed to the application as command
line. i recommend to work without command line arguments, since these are not
supported by all operating systems. As a result, your applications will not
be portable if they depend on command line arguments. Instead, consider using
system properties or configuration files.</p>
<p><strong>workingDirectory</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- optional</tt></p>
<p>This attribute defines the working directory for the application at the time
it is launched. i would recommend some caution in relying on this too heavily
if your application should be portable, since this might not be supported by
all operating systems. At this time i don't have enough information to make a
definite statement one way or the other. The value is translated through the
variable substitutor. Therefore variables such as <tt class="docutils literal">$INSTALL_PATH</tt> can be
used to describe the directory.</p>
<p><strong>description</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- optional</tt></p>
<p>The value of this attribute will be visible to the user when a brief
description about associated application is requested. The form of the
request and the way in which this description is displayed varies between
operating systems. On MS-Windows the description is shown as a tool tip when
the mouse cursor hovers over the icon for a few seconds. On some operating
systems this feature might not be supported but i think it is always a good
idea to include a brief description.</p>
<p><strong>iconFile</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- optional</tt></p>
<p>The value of this attribute points to the file that holds the icon that
should be displayed as a symbol for this shortcut. This value is also
translated through the variable substitutor and consequently can contain
variables such as $INSTALL_PATH. If this attribute is omitted, no icon will
be specified for the shortcut. Usually this causes the OS to display an OS
supplied default icon. <strong>The use of this attribute is also likely to change
once other operating systems are supported. Read the Section about Icons
below, for more information.</strong></p>
<p><strong>iconIndex</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- optional</tt></p>
<p>If the file type for the icon supports multiple icons in one file, then this
attribute may be used to specify the correct index for the icon. i would also
advise against using this feature, because of operating system
incompatibilities in this area. In file formats that do not support multiple
icons, this values is ignored.</p>
<p><strong>initialState</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- optional</tt></p>
<p>There are four values accepted for this attribute: <tt class="docutils literal">noShow</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">normal</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">maximized</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">minimized</tt>. If the target operating system supports this
feature, then this value will have the appropriate influence on the initial
window state of the application. <tt class="docutils literal">noShow</tt> is particularly useful when
launch scripts are used that cause a command window to open, because the
command window will not be visible with this option. For instance on MS-
Windows starting a batch file that launches a Java application has the less
than pretty side effect that two windows show: the DOS command prompt and the
Java application window. Even if the shortcut is configured to show
minimized, there are buttons for both windows in the task bar. Using
<tt class="docutils literal">noShow</tt> will completely eliminate this effect, only the Java application
window will be visible. <em>On Unix use</em> <tt class="docutils literal">normal</tt> <em>, because this is not
supported</em>.</p>
<p><strong>programGroup</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- <span class="pre">semi-optional</span></tt></p>
<p>The value for this attribute can be either yes or no. Any other value will be
interpreted as no. If the value is yes, then a copy of this shortcut will be
placed in the group menu. <em>On Unix (KDE) this will always be placed on the
top level.</em></p>
<p><strong>desktop</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- <span class="pre">semi-optional</span></tt></p>
<p>For this attribute the value should also be yes or no. If the value is yes,
then a copy of the shortcut is placed on the desktop. <em>On Unix the shortcuts
will only be placed on the (KDE-) desktop of the user, who currently runs the
installer. For Gnome the user can simply copy the *.desktop files from</em>
<tt class="docutils literal">/Desktop</tt> <em>to</em> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/gnome-desktop</span></tt>. (This is already a TODO for the Unix-
shortcut implementation.)</p>
<p><strong>applications</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- <span class="pre">semi-optional</span></tt></p>
<p>This is also a yes/no attribute. If the value is yes, then a copy of the
shortcut is placed in the applications menu (if the target operating system
supports this). This is the same location as the applications choice for the
program group. <em>This makes no sense on Unix.</em></p>
<p><strong>startMenu</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- <span class="pre">semi-optional</span></tt></p>
<p>This is a yes/no attribute as well. If the value is yes, then a copy of the
shortcut is placed directly in the top most menu that is available for
placing application shortcuts. <em>This is not supported on Unix. see above.</em></p>
<p><strong>startup</strong> <tt class="docutils literal">- <span class="pre">semi-optional</span></tt></p>
<p>This is also a yes/no attribute. If the value is yes, then a copy of the
shortcut is placed in a location where all applications get automatically
started at OS launch time, if this is available on the target OS. <em>This is
also not supported on Unix.</em></p>

this can never be run, until the <tt class="docutils literal">workingDirectory</tt> does not contain

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Selective Creation of Shortcuts</a></h1>
<p>Usually all shortcuts that are listed will be created when the user clicks
the 'Next' button. However it is possible to control to some degree if
specific shortcuts should be created or not. This is based on install
conditions. By including one or more <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;createForPack <span class="pre">name=''a</span> pack name''
/&gt;</tt> tags in the specification for a shortcut, you can direct the
ShortcutPanel to create the shortcut only if any of the listed packs are
actually installed. The 'name' attribute is used to define the name of one of
the packs for which the shortcut should be created. You do not need to list
all packs if a shortcut should always be created. In this case simply omit
this tag altogether.</p>
<p><strong>A word of caution</strong></p>
<p>For any shortcut that is always created, i would recommend to omit this tag,
since i have seen a number of problems related to changing pack names. You
can save yourself some troubleshooting and some Aspirin by not using this
feature if it's not required. On the other hand if you need it i would advise
to be very careful about changing pack names.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="localizing-shortcuts">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Localizing shortcuts</a></h1>
<p>The izPack installer allows localization of your installer. Obviously, you will
want your shortcuts labels to be localized, too. Thus, you can provide
shortcutSpec files for each language you support.</p>
<p>This works just like localizing other specs for other panels : add an
underscore and the iso3 language code to the end of the resource name, and set
the source name to the appropriate localized spec file.
As for the platforms, if a specific spec file is not declared for the current
language, the installer will revert to the default <tt class="docutils literal">shortcutSpec.xml</tt> resource.
This way, you can for example have a resource <tt class="docutils literal">shortcutSpec.xml_fra</tt> for
french installs and have the default resource <tt class="docutils literal">shortcutSpec.xml</tt> (maybe
containing strings in english) be used for other languages.</p>
<p>The platform prefix and language suffix are combined like in this example :
<tt class="docutils literal">Unix_shortcutSpec.xml_fra</tt>.</p>
<p>When the installer can't find such a platform-and-language-specific resource,
it will fallback to a suitable default using the following search order :
<tt class="docutils literal">shortcutSpec.xml_&lt;iso3&gt;</tt> (default platform, language-specific)
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;platform&gt;_shortcutSpec.xml</tt> (default language, platform-specific)
<tt class="docutils literal">shortcutSpec.xml</tt> (default platform and language)</p>
<p>Reminder: If the shortcut panel does not find one of these named resources,
it will never appear. So, do not use different resource names and do not add
a path to these.</p>

<div class="section" id="shortcut-tips">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Shortcut Tips</a></h1>
<p>I wrote this section to provide additional information about issues
surrounding the creation of shortcuts. Reading this section is not necessary
to successfully create shortcuts, but it might help you creating an
installation that works more smoothly. In addition, it might give you some
knowledge about operating systems that you don't know so well. In fact most
of the issues described in this section are focused on differences in
operating system specifics.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-desktop">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">The Desktop</a></h2>
<p>You should recognize that the desktop is precious real estate for many
people. They like to keep it uncluttered and keep only the things there that
they use on a regular basis. This is not true for everybody and you might
personally think different about this. Still, the fact remains that a lot of
people might have different feelings about it, so you should not
automatically assume that it is ok to place all of your shortcuts on the
desktop proper. While your application is certainly one of the most important
things for you, for your customers it is probably one of many applications
they use and maybe not even the most important one. Accordingly, placing more
shortcut icons there than they feel they will use on a regular basis and
especially doing this without asking for permission might trigger some bad
temper.</p>
<p>Annotation: But even the experienced user should be able to organize their
Desktop. On Linux the users desktop is the only place, which supports any
kind of shortcuts.</p>
<p>It is common practice to create a program group in the application menu
system of the OS and place all shortcuts that go with an application in that
program group. In addition, only one shortcut to the key access point of the
application is placed directly on the desktop. Many installers first ask for
permission to do so, as does the ShortcutPanel in IzPack.</p>
<p>I would like to recommend that you always create a shortcut in the menu
system, even if your application has only one access point and you are
placing this on the desktop. Note that shortcuts can also be placed directly
in the menu, they don't need to be in a program group. There are two reasons
for doing so.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the user elects not to create shortcuts on the desktop, they will
end up with no access point to your application</li>
<li>Even if this works fine, occasionally people 'clean up' their
desktop. They might later find that they accidentally deleted the only
access point to your application. For the less technology savvy users,
recreating the shortcut might be a rough experience.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="icons">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Icons</a></h2>
<p>Icons are supplied in image files, usually in some kind of bitmap format.
Unfortunately there is no format that is universally recognized by all
operating systems. If you would like to create shortcuts on a variety of
operating systems that use your own icons, you must supply each icon in a
number of different formats. This chapter discusses icon file formats used on
various operating systems. Fortunately there are good programs available that
allow you to convert between these formats, so that creating the different
files is not much of a problem once the icons themselves are created.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Windows</strong></p>
<p>Windows prefers to use its native icon file format. Files of this type
usually use the extension .ico. These so called ICO files can hold multiple
icons in one file, which can be useful if the same icon is to be provided in
a number of sizes and color-depths.</p>
<p>Windows itself selects the icon with the most matching dimensions and
displays it. While the Start menu displays the icon with 16x16 pixel if
available, the desktop displays the 32x32 pixel resolution of the same ICO if
this is in.</p>
<p>In other words, a ICO file has embedded one or more dimensions of the same
Icon. We recommend to play with <cite>microangelo</cite>.</p>
<p>Dlls and Exe files on the other side, can store, amongst other things, a
collection of different Icons. You can select your desired Icon by its index.
The lowest index is 0. Use the iconIndex attribute in the spec file to
specify this index.</p>
<p>As a sample look into</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
%SystemRoot%\system32\shell32.dll
</pre>
<p>These contains a lot of Windows own icons. You can use the <cite>PE Explorer</cite> or
another Resource Editor to extract or modify Icons in dlls or exe files. But
be warned. You can also destroy a working application with these kind of
tools.</p>
<p>At least Windows also supports the use of bitmap files in the .bmp format as
icons. Note that this format does not support multiple icons.</p>
<p>We might have overlooked other file formats that are supported by Windows.
However, we suggest to test other formats for compatibility as they might not
work all the way back to Windows 95 or on the NT/non-NT strain. Sticking with
one of these two formats should keep you out of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Apple</strong></p>
<p>Apple Macintosh systems use the Macintosh PICT format, extension .pct. If
you are working with an apple system you know a whole lot more about this
format than i do. If you don't but would like to be able to install your
application on a Mac, simply start with any bitmap format that you feel
comfortable to work with. Then find an application that is capable of
converting this format into a .pct file. i like to use Paint Shop Pro (PC
based), because it provides conversion capabilities among several dozen
different file formats.</p>
<p><strong>UNIX flavors</strong></p>
<p>by Marc Eppelmann</p>
<p>As my knowledge, all X based Unix Window systems supports the (ASCII-) XBM
(X-Bitmap ) and the better XPM (X-PixMap) format. The modern GUI systems like
KDE and Gnome can display additionally a lot of other ImageIcon formats, such
as GIF, JPG, and PNG.</p>
<p>i suggest to use PNG, because this can lossless compress like the GIF format,
however this format is absolutely free. And not least, this can store true
transparency informations (It has an alpha channel).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="targets">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Targets</a></h2>
<p>So, you thought you could escape the ugly mess of operating system
dependencies at least with the way how your Java application is started?
Sorry but i have just another bad message. The one positive thing is that
here you have a way of escaping, even if doing so has a few less pretty side
effects. At first, i would like to discuss various launching options you have
available on different operating systems. At the end of the chapter i write
about a way to make launching your application OS independent.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Windows</strong></p>
<p>On Microsoft Windows you have a variety of options for launching your
application. Probably the most simple case is directly starting the Java VM
from the command line and typing out all parameters, such as class path, the
class name etc. In principle, this can be placed right in a shortcut and
should work.</p>
<p>A little more elegant solution is to place this in a batch file and have the
shortcut point to this batch file. This will also make it more likely that
users can repair or recreate shortcuts. Recreating shortcuts with
sophisticated command lines is practically impossible.</p>
<p>Another method is less commonly used but just as possible. Implement a native
executable that launches the VM with your Java application. The VM comes as
DLL and is used by java.exe in just the same way. As a sample look at the
exlipse.exe provided by the <cite>Eclipse-IDE</cite></p>
<p>Clearly, even though the first option is a bit ugly and has some
restrictionss, it is the most portable solution among the three.</p>
<p><strong>Apple</strong></p>
<p>We hope, there is a IzPack developer currently researching for the details
for the Mac environment. We expect an updated chapter in one of the next
releases.</p>
<p><strong>UNIX</strong></p>
<p>UNIX provides essentially the same options as Windows. You can simply use the
command line option, you can write a shell script and you can write a native
launcher. Naturally this stuff is in no way compatible with the equivalent
Windows implementations. The native option is even more problematic in this
environment, since the code can not even be moved from one UNIX platform to
another, without recompilation.</p>
<p><strong>OS Independent Launching</strong></p>
<p>So, after all this rather discouraging news, there is actually a portable way
to launch Java applications? You bet! although i have to admit that it is not
necessarily the most pretty way of doing things.</p>
<p>This approach is currently used by IzPack. Package your application in a
.jar file if you don't already do so and make it executable by including the
necessary metaINF/MANIFEST.MF information file. i am not going into all the
details on how exactly to do this, the Java documentation will have to do.
You might have noticed that even though the instructions to install IzPack
say to type :</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
java -jar IzPack-install.jar
</pre>
<p>You can just as well double click on IzPack-install.jar and it will start up.
This procedure will work on all GUI based Java supported operating systems
-though you might have to replace double clicking with dropping the file on
the VM. In just the same way, you can make the .jar file itself the target
of a shortcut. Note: This works only, if jars are registered as files, which
have to launch by the installed JRE (with: javaw.exe -jar)</p>
<p>The one restriction with this approach is that a .jar file can only have one
main file. So, if you have multiple targets, they need to be packaged each
into a different .jar file. They can be in one .jar file but then you have
to start them explicitly, which gets you back to the problems that i
mentioned before. This brings me to the ugly part. If you have just one
target, then you are all set. If you have multiple targets, you need to
create a .jar file for each of them. In addition, you have a much harder
time setting the classpath, because each of the .jar files that contain
supporting code must be listed. In fact, at present there is no way of
setting this during the installation, because IzPack does not yet (version
3.0) support the setting and modification of environment variables.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="command-line">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Command Line</a></h1>
<p>Before i start to write a lot about the use of command line arguments let me
state this: If you can avoid using them, do it! Not that there is anything
wrong with command line arguments as such. The issue is simply that if you
want your application to be usable cross platform (the big Java promise) you
should shy away from using command line arguments. The problem here is that
not all operating systems actually support command line arguments. To be more
precise, to my knowledge only Apple operating systems do not support command
line parameters. If you don't care for running your application on a Mac,
then you might not worry about his at all. If you are interested to support
the Mac as well, read on.</p>
<p>In fact the Mac lower than MacOSX supports command line parameters in a way.
More to the point, it supports a single parameter that your application
should interpret as the name of a data file to open. You have no way of
supplying this to your application through the command line attribute. The
operating system generates this when the user drops the file on your
application and then passes it as command line argument. That's it. This same
behavior will probably fly well on pretty much any system and should
therefore be an ok implementation.</p>
<p>So what to do if you want to modify program behavior based on runtime
switches? For one thing, you could set system properties accordingly. The
disadvantage here is the same as with the command line parameters: the way of
setting these might vary between operating systems. The best way seems to be
using a property file that contains the configuration data.</p>

<div class="section" id="trouble-shooting">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Trouble Shooting</a></h1>
<p>by Elmar</p>
<p>It has been some time since i wrote this chapter during which a good number
of users had a chance to gather experience. Unfortunately i never know how
many have used it successfully without much difficulty. i only hear from
those that have encountered one problem or another. The type of problems that
i have seen prompted me to write this section, because i think it will help
you in locating most problems that you might encounter or at least give you
some idea where the problem might be located.</p>
<div class="section" id="problems-you-can-solve">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">Problems You Can Solve</a></h2>
<p>If you see an exception that essentially says that a library can not be
loaded (ShellLink.dll) you have an easy problem to deal with. Your installer
file is probably missing the native tag that adds the Windows dll to the
installer or something with this tag is no quite right. Read 'What to Add to
the Installer' for all details on this topic.</p>
<p>Most other problems cause the ShortcutPanel not to show at all during the
installation process. The reason is simply that the ShortcutPanel skips if it
does not know what to do or if it has nothing to do (no point showing then
and confusing the user). The problem is that this is not always what you
intended. The most simple but not so uncommon case is, that the ShortcutPanel
cannot find their spec file. This can be caused by a number of reasons. The
associated resource tag might be missing in the installer specification file,
the target file name might be misspelled (the name you specify for the <tt class="docutils literal">id</tt>
attribute) or the target file name has a path or package name pre-pended. You
have only to use <tt class="docutils literal">shortcutSpec.xml</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">Unix_shortcutSpec.xml</tt> and
nothing else, just as described in 'What to Add to the Installer'. You can
always verify if this part is ok by inspecting the content of the installer
.jar file. The file shortcutSpec.xml should be located in the directory
<tt class="docutils literal">res</tt>. This inspection can be performed with any zip tool. If the file is
not there, first correct this before proceeding.</p>
<p>If the file is there and the panel does not appear, you have a problem within
the specification file. In most cases that i have seen, it comes down to a
spelling mistake of an attribute or tag name. You just have to carefully make
sure that everything is spelled correctly. Don't forget that all names are
case sensitive! In a few cases it is also happend, that required or semi-
optional attributes are omitted, so you might want to verify if all
attributes that you need are actually supplied.</p>
<p>If everything is correct up to this point the problem becomes more elusive.
Most likely the panel will not be displayed, because it is instructed not to
show. There are be several reasons for this. The simple case is that no
location has been specified for the shortcuts in your installation. This can
happen if all five location attributes are omitted or if all the ones that
are listed are set to <tt class="docutils literal">no</tt>. Remember, you have to specify at least one
location for every shortcut. If this is also correct, you might have used the
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;createForPack&gt;</tt> tag. Review the details in 'Selective Creation of
Shortcuts'. One possibility for the panel not to show is that based on the
packs that are currently selected for installation no shortcut qualifies for
creation. In this case the panel will not show, this is perfectly normal
behavior. More likely this condition is true because of some accident and not
because it's intended. Make sure the packs that you list for the shortcut are
actually defined in your installation and verify that they are all spelled
correctly. Remember: case matters! Did the ShortcutPanel use to work in your
installation and all of a sudden stopped working? Very likely you are dealing
with the last problem. A package name might have been modified and the
shortcut spec was not adjusted to stay in sync.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="problems-that-have-no-solution-yet">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Problems That Have No Solution (yet)</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately one problem has been very persistent and only recently one user
found the reason. The problem occurs when installing on some target systems
where non-English characters are used in the storage path for the shortcuts.
The problem is that these characters don't seem to be properly translated
across the Java Native Interface. This leads to a situation where the proper
path can not be located and the shortcut creation fails. i write 'some target
systems' because it does not fail everywhere. After much agonizing over this
problem, one user found the solution: The shortcut creation works fine if a
Sun virtual machine is installed, but fails if a version from IBM happens to
be installed. So far i have no solution for this problem but i am trying to
find a workaround the problem.</p>
