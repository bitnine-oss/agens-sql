<h1 class="title">Foreword</h1>

<p>This documentation is a collective work that received many inputs over the years from many people, notably Julien Ponge, Elmar Grom, Fabrice Mirabile, Tino Schwarze, Klaus Bartz and many more.</p>
<p>We tried to keep it as up-to-date as possible despite a few source format changes and many times where we did not check that new features were properly documented.</p>
<p>If you believe that some portions could be enhanced, fixed, or if you find that some features are not properly documented, feel-free to help us!</p>
