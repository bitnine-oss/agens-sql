scanner.c is a scanner which uses a state machine to walk through a
set of SQL statements and identify where the ends of statements are
(e.g. - relevant ";"'s).

It needs to handle various forms of quoting, notably with "double
quotes", 'single quotes', and $dol$dollar quoting$dol$.

This is integrated into both slon and slonik in order to split DDL
requests being submitted via EXECUTE SCRIPT into individual
statements, each submitted to the backend as a separate query.

If you're running this test on Windows, you will need to convert line
endings in emptytestresult.expected and test_sql.expected into DOS
form...
