****** 21. Slony-I Test Bed Framework ******
As of version 1.2, Slony-I has a common test bed framework intended to better
support performing a comprehensive set of tests. The code lives in the source
tree under the tests directory.
Here are some of the vital files...
    * run_test.sh
This is the central script for running tests. Typical usage is thus:
./run_test.sh
usage ./run_test.sh testname
You need to specify the subdirectory name of the test set to be run; each such
set is stored in a subdirectory of tests.
You may need to set one or more of the following environment variables to
reflect your local configuration. For instance, the writer runs "test1" against
PostgreSQL 8.0.x using the following command line:

 PGBINDIR=/opt/OXRS/dbs/pgsql8/bin PGPORT=5532 PGUSER=cbbrowne ./run_test.sh test1

  PGBINDIR
      This determines where the test scripts look for PostgreSQL and Slony-
      I binaries. The default is /usr/local/pgsql/bin
      There are also variables PGBINDIR1 thru PGBINDIR13 which allows you to
      specify a separate path for each database instance. That will be
      particularly useful when testing interoperability of Slony-I across
      different versions of PostgreSQL. In order to create a database of each
      respective version, you need to point to an initdb of the appropriate
      version.
  PGPORT
      This indicates what port the backend is on. By default, 5432 is used.
      There are also variables PORT1 thru PORT13 which allows you to specify a
      separate port number for each database instance. That will be
      particularly useful when testing interoperability of Slony-I across
      different versions of PostgreSQL.
  PGUSER
      By default, the user postgres is used; this is taken as the default user
      ID to use for all of the databases as the 'generic' user and as the user
      that a slon connects to its node as.
      There are also variables USER1 thru USER13 which allow specifying a
      separate user name for each database instance.  As always, with Slony-I,
      this needs to be a PostgreSQL "superuser."
  WEAKUSER
      By default, this user is 'weakuser'.  It is set up to have read-only 
      permissions on the Slony-I schema and on the replicated tables.
  HOST
      By default, localhost is used.
      There are also variables HOST1 thru HOST13 which allow specifying a
      separate host for each database instance.
  DB1 thru DB13
      By default, slonyregress1 thru slonyregress13 are used.
      You may override these from the environment.
  ENCODING
      By default, UNICODE is used, so that tests can create UTF8 tables and
      test the multibyte capabilities.
