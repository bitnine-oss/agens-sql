This script expects to have a suitable PostgreSQL installation in $PATH

It then drops/creates database "test1538", creates *one* Slony-I node,
starts up a slon against it, and throws some pgbench updates at it.

You should then take a look at the node, to see that sl_event and
sl_log_1 are getting trimmed out even though there is only a single
node.
