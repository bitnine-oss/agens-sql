The bulk_load_for_slony.pl tool will do a bulk load of a table that
is being replicated by Slony-I but that is not being actively used.
Note that this bulk load tool has features that can and will break
replication if you are the least bit unwary and if you do not understand
what it is doing.  PLEASE READ THE DOCUMENTATION.

For documentation, see the perldoc documentation included in the
enclosed file. PLEASE READ IT. Use perldoc bulk_load_for_slony.pl to
read it.

If this script breaks your replication cluster, well, we told you
it would.
