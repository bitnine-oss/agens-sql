<para>If you are having problems with &slony1;, you have several
options for help:

<sect2>
<title>&slony1; Website</title>
<para> <ulink url="http://slony.info/">http://slony.info/</ulink> - the official
<quote>home</quote> of &slony1; contains links to the documentation,
mailing lists and source code.  </para>

<title>
Mailing Lists</title>
<para>
The answer to your problem may exist
in the Slony1-general mailing list archives, or you may choose to ask
your question on the Slony1-general mailing list. The mailing list
archives, and instructions for joining the list may be found <ulink
      url="http://lists.slony.info/mailman/listinfo/slony1-general">here. </ulink>. </para>

<para>
If you are a question to the mailing list then you should try to include
the following information:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> The version of &slony1; you are using</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> The version of &postgres; you are using</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> A description of your replication cluster.  This should
include the number of replication sets, which node is the master for
each set. </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The text of any error messages you are receiving  from
slony</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>If you received the error while running a slonik script
then try to include the script</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
It is a good idea to run the &lteststate; tool before posting
a question to the mailing list.  It may give some clues as to what is
wrong, and the results are likely to be of some assistance in
analyzing the problem. </para>

<listitem><para>There are several articles here
<ulink
      url="http://www.varlena.com/GeneralBits/Tidbits/index.php#Replication">
Varlena GeneralBits </ulink> that may be helpful but was written for an older
version of &slony1;.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> IRC - There are usually some people on #slony on
irc.freenode.net who may be able to answer some of your
questions. Many people leave themselves logged into IRC and
only periodically check the channel.  It might take a while
before someone answers your questions</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> <ulink url="http://www.pgpool.net"
      id="pgpool"> <application>
      pgpool </application> </ulink> </para>

<para> <application>pgpool</application> is a connection pool server
for &postgres;; it allows an application to connect to it as if it
were a standard &postgres; server.  It caches connections, which
reduces the overhead involved in establishing them.  It supports a
<quote>scheduled switchover</quote> feature, which would allow
dynamically switching over from one server to another.  That would be
very useful when doing a <xref linkend="stmtmoveset">, as it would
allow applications to be switched to point to the new origin without
needing to update their configuration. </para> </listitem>
