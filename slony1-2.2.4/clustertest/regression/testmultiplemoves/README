testmultiplemoves is a test that exercises MOVE SET on a 3 node
cluster with 10 replication sets.
  
The interesting bit is that it requests MOVE SET on all 10 sets...

This may be expected to "stress" things such as...

- Auto generation of partial indexes on sl_log_? tables
- Locking and unlocking sets
