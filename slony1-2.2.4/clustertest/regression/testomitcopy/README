  
This test validates the OMIT COPY functionality added to SUBSCRIBE SET
  
It creates three simple tables as one replication set, and replicates
them from one database to another.
  
The tables are of the several interesting types:
  
1.  table1 has a formal primary key

2.  table2 lacks a formal primary key, but has a candidate primary key

3.  table4 which has columns of all sorts of vaguely esoteric types to
exercise that points, paths, bitmaps, mac addresses, and inet types
replicate properly.

4.  table5 has a composite primary key (on id1,id2,id3) where
the primary key attributes are strewn throughout the table.  This is
to make sure we have a case that exercises the logic that changed with
bug #18.
