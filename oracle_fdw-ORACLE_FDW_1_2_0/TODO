Support for IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA
---------------------------------

Starting with PostgreSQL 9.5, this command can be used to create a bunch of
foreign tables corresponding to a remote schema in one statement.

This means adding a new callback "oracleImportForeignSchema", surrounded by
#ifdefs for conditional compilation on PostgreSQL > 9.4 only.

There should be some automatism for column type conversions.

Since Oracle names default to upper case, it would be nice to have some
support for case folding.  I envision an option "lowercase" with possible
values "off" (leave names as they are), "on" (always fold to lower case)
and "smart" (the default, only fold names that consist of capitals only).
