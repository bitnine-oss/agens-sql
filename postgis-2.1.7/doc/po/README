Translation files for the PostGIS manual.

Compilation of the files require the ``poxml`` package,
part of the KDE development kit.

Run ``make`` in language directories to generate the 
localized manual.

Run ``make update-po`` from the parent directory to
update the translation files to be in sync with the 
official documentation.
