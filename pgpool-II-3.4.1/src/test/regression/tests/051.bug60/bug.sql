-- This script shows the problem. When run in a psql connected to
-- pgpool with one master and one read-only replica, this will cause
-- the pgpool process to exit because the exception found in the
-- commit (in the master node) does not match the success code for the
-- commit in the read-only replica.

-- The expected behavior would be to continue execution normally
-- without dropping the connection.
