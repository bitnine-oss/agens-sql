<h1 style="margin-top: 20px">What is pgpool-II?<a name="whatis"></a></h1>

<p> pgpool-II is a middle ware that sits between PostgreSQL servers
and a PostgreSQL database client. It provides the following features:</p>

<p>
<ul>

<li>Connection Pooling</li>
    <p>pgpool-II maintains established connections to the PostgreSQL servers, and
    reuses them whenever a new connection with the same properties
    (i.e. user name, database, protocol version) comes in. It reduces the
    connection overhead, and improves system's overall throughput.</p>

<li>Replication</li>
    <p>pgpool-II can manage multiple PostgreSQL servers. Activating the
    replication feature makes it possible to create a real time backup on 2 or
    more PostgreSQL clusters, so that the service can continue without interruption
    if one of those clusters fails.</p>

<li>Load Balance</li>
    <p>If a database is replicated(because running in either replication mode or master/slave mode),
    performing a SELECT query on any
    server will return the same result. pgpool-II takes advantage of
    the replication feature in order to reduce the load on each PostgreSQL server.
    It does that by distributing SELECT queries among available servers, improving
    the system's overall throughput. In an ideal scenario, read performance could
    improve proportionally to the number of PostgreSQL servers. Load balancing works
    best in a scenario where there are a lot of users executing many read-only
    queries at the same time.</p>

<li>Limiting Exceeding Connections</li>
    <p>There is a limit on the maximum number of concurrent
    connections with PostgreSQL, and new connections are rejected when this
    number is reached. Raising this maximum number of connections, however,
    increases resource consumption and has a negative impact on overall system
    performance. pgpool-II also has a limit on the maximum number of
    connections, but extra connections will be queued instead of returning
    an error immediately.</p>

<li>Parallel Query</li>
    <p class="version_notice">
    <em class="caution">DEPRECATED</em> :
    This mode is deprecated and will be removed in the future release (possibly 3.5).
    </p>
    <p>Using the parallel query feature, data can be split
    among multiple servers, so that a query can be executed on all the
    servers concurrently, reducing the overall execution time. Parallel query
    works best when searching large-scale data.</p>

</ul>
</p>

<p>pgpool-II speaks PostgreSQL's backend and frontend protocol, and
relays messages between a backend and a frontend. Therefore, a database application
(frontend) thinks that pgpool-II is the actual PostgreSQL server, and
the server (backend) sees pgpool-II as one of its clients. Because
pgpool-II is transparent to both the server and the client, an
existing database application can be used with pgpool-II almost
without a change to its source code.</p>

<p>
<strong>There are some restrictions to using SQL via pgpool-II.
See <a href="#restriction">Restrictions</a> for more details.</strong>

<!-- ================================================================================ -->

<h1>Supported Platforms<a name="platform"></a></h1>

<p>pgpool-II works on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and most of the
UNIX-like architectures. Windows is not supported. Supported
PostgreSQL server's versions are 6.4 and higher. To use the parallel
query feature, however, 7.4 and higher must be used.</p>

<p>If you are using PostgreSQL 7.3 or older, some features of pgpool-II
won't be available. But you shouldn't use such an old release anyway.</p>

<p>You must also make sure that all of your PostgreSQL servers are using the same
major PostgreSQL version.
In addition to this, we do not recommend mixing different PostgreSQL installation with different build options: including supporting SSL or not, to use --disable-integer-datetimes or not, different block size.
These might affect part of functionality of pgpool-II.
The difference of PostgreSQL minor versions is not usually a problem. However we do not test every occurrence of minor versions and we recommend to use exact same minor version of PostgreSQL.
</p>

<p class="top_link"><a href="#Top">back to top</a></p>

<h1>pgpool-II Installation<a name="install"></a></h1>

<p>
pgpool-II can be downloaded from the <a href="http://pgpool.net/">pgpool Development page</a>.
Packages are also provided for various platforms including CentOS, RedHat Enterprise Linux, Fedora and Debian.
Check appropriate repository.
</p>

<p>
pgpool-II's source code can be downloaded from:
<a href="http://pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Downloads">pgpool development page</a>
</p>

<p>Installing pgpool-II from source code requires gcc 2.9 or higher, and GNU
make. Also, pgpool-II links with the libpq library, so the libpq library and its development
headers must be installed on the machine used to build pgpool-II.  Additionally
the OpenSSL library and its development headers must be present in order to
enable OpenSSL support in pgpool-II.</p>

<dl>
<dt>configure</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>After extracting the source tarball, execute the configure script.</p>

    </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="install_functions">Installing functions</h2>

<h3>Installing pgpool_regclass (recommended) <span class="version">V3.0 -</span></h3>
<p>
If you are using PostgreSQL 8.0 or later, installing pgpool_regclass function on all PostgreSQL
to be accessed by pgpool-II is strongly recommended, as it is used internally by pgpool-II.
Without this, handling of duplicate table names in different schema
might cause trouble (temporary tables aren't a problem).
</p>

<pre>
$ cd pgpool-II-x.x.x/sql/pgpool-regclass
$ make
$ make install
</pre>

<p>After this:<p>
<pre>
$ psql -f pgpool-regclass.sql template1
</pre>

<p>or<p>

<pre>
$ psql template1
=# CREATE EXTENSION pgpool_regclass;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Executing pgpool-regclass.sql or <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> should be performed on every databases accessed
with pgpool-II.
You do not need to do this for a database created after the
execution of "<code>psql -f pgpool-regclass.sql template1</code>" or <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>,
as this template database will be cloned to create new databases.
</p>

<h3>Creating insert_lock table <span class="version">V3.0 -</span></h3>
<p>
If you use insert_lock in replication mode, creating pgpool_catalog.insert_lock
table for mutual exclusion is strongly recommended.
Without this, insert_lock works so far. However in that case pgpool-II locks
against the insert target table. This behavior is same as pgpool-II 2.2 and 2.3
series. The table lock conflicts with VACUUM. So INSERT processing may be thereby
kept waiting for a long time.
</p>

<pre>
$ cd pgpool-II-x.x.x/sql
$ psql -f insert_lock.sql template1
</pre>

<p>
Executing insert_lock.sql should be performed on every databases accessed
with pgpool-II.
You do not need to do this for a database created after the execution of
"<code>psql -f insert_lock.sql template1</code>", as this template database will be
cloned to create new databases.
</p>

<h3>Installing pgpool_recovery</h3>

<p>If you use <a href="#online_recovery_in_stream_mode">online recovery</a>, some functions are needed:
pgpool_recovery, pgpool_remote_start, pgpool_switch_xlog.</p>
<p>And, pgpoolAdmin of the tool to control pgpool-II can stop, restart and reload the backend PostgreSQL nodes,
and it needs the function named pgpool_pgctl.</p>
<p>
Also pgpoolAdmin needs function pgpool_pgctl to stop/restart/reload config PostgreSQL.
</p>
<p>
You can install those 4 functions in a same manner as pgpool_regclass.
However, unlike pgpool_regclass, you only need to install those functions to template1 database.
</p>

<p>Here is the way to install those functions.</p>
<p>
<pre>
$ cd pgpool-II-x.x.x/sql/pgpool-recovery
$ make
$ make install
</pre>

<p>After this:<p>
<pre>
$ psql -f pgpool-recovery.sql template1
</pre>

<p>or<p>

<pre>
$ psql template1
=# CREATE EXTENSION pgpool_recovery;
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Configuring pgpool.pg_ctl <span class="version">V3.3 -</span></h4>

<p>The function pgpool_pgctl executes the command whose path is specified by "pgpool.pg_ctl" in postgresql.conf.
To use this function, you have to specify this parameter.</p>
<pre>
ex)
$ cat &gt;&gt; /usr/local/pgsql/postgresql.conf
pgpool.pg_ctl = '/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl'

$ pg_ctl reload -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
</pre>

<h1>Configuring pgpool-II<a name="config"></a></h1>

<p>Default configuration files for pgpool-II are
<code>/usr/local/etc/pgpool.conf</code> and
<code>/usr/local/etc/pcp.conf</code>. Several operation modes are available
in pgpool-II. Each mode has associated features which
can be enabled or disabled, and specific configuration parameters to
control their behaviors.</p>

    <li>(*2) Online recovery can be used with Master slave+Streaming replication.</li>
    <li>(*3) Clients simply connect to the PostgreSQL servers
        via pgpool-II. This mode is useful for simply limiting excess
        connections to the servers, or enabling failover with multiple servers.

    </ul>

<h2 id="pcp_conf">Configuring <code>pcp.conf</code></h2>

<p>pgpool-II provides a control interface where an administrator
can collect pgpool-II status, and terminate pgpool-II processes remotely.
<code>pcp.conf</code> is the user/password file used for
authentication by this interface. All operation modes require the
<code>pcp.conf</code> file to be set. A <code>$prefix/etc/pcp.conf.sample</code>
file is created during the installation of pgpool-II. Rename the file to
<code>pcp.conf</code> and add your user name and password to it.
</p>

<pre>
cp $prefix/etc/pcp.conf.sample $prefix/etc/pcp.conf
</pre>
<p>
An empty line or a line starting with "<code>#</code>" is treated as a
comment and will be ignored. A user name and its associated password must be
written as one line using the following format:
</p>
<pre>
username:[password encrypted in md5]
</pre>
<p>
<code>[password encrypted in md5]</code> can be produced with the
<code>$prefix/bin/pg_md5</code> command.
</p>

<pre>
pg_md5 -p
password: &lt;your password&gt;
</pre>
<p>
or
</p>
<pre>
./pg_md5 foo
acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8
</pre>
<p>
The <code>pcp.conf</code> file must be readable by the user who
executes pgpool-II.</p>

<h2 id="pgpool_conf">Configuring <code>pgpool.conf</code></h2>

<p>As already explained, each operation mode has its specific
configuration parameters in <code>pgpool.conf</code>. A
<code>$prefix/etc/pgpool.conf.sample</code> file is created during the
installation of pgpool-II. Rename the file to
<code>pgpool.conf</code> and edit its contents.

<pre>
cp $prefix/etc/pgpool.conf.sample $prefix/etc/pgpool.conf

<h3>Connections</h3>

<dl>
<dt><a name="LISTEN_ADDRESS"></a>listen_addresses</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Specifies the hostname or IP address, on which pgpool-II will accept
    TCP/IP connections. <code>'*'</code> accepts
    all incoming connections. <code>''</code> disables TCP/IP
    connections. Default is <code>'localhost'</code>. Connections via UNIX
    domain socket are always accepted.

     This parameter can only be set at server start.</p>
    </dd>

<dt><a name="SOCKET_DIR"></a>socket_dir</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The directory where the UNIX domain socket accepting connections for
    pgpool-II will be created. Default is <code>'/tmp'</code>. Be
    aware that this socket might be deleted by a cron job. We recommend to
    set this value to <code>'/var/run'</code> or such directory.

<h3>Pools</h3>

<dl>
<dt><a name="NUM_INIT_CHILDREN"></a>num_init_children</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The number of preforked pgpool-II server processes. Default is 32.
    num_init_children is also the concurrent connections limit to pgpool-II from clients.
    If more than num_init_children clients try to connect to pgpool-II,
    they are blocked (not rejected) until a connection to any pgpool-II process is closed.
    Up to listen_backlog_multiplier*num_init_children can be queued.
		</p>
		<p>
		The queued is inside the kernel called "listen queue". The length of the listen queue is called "backlog".
		There is an upper limit of the backlog in some systems, and if num_init_children*listen_backlog_multiplier exceeds the number, you need to set the backlong higher. Otherwise, following problems may occur in heavy loaded systems: 1) connecting to pgpool-II fails 2) connecting to pgpool-II is getting slow because of retries in the kernel.
		You can check if the listen queue is actually overflowed by using "netstat -s" command.
		If you find something like:
		</p>
		<pre>
535 times the listen queue of a socket overflowed
		</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
then the listen queue is definitely overflowed.
		You should increase the backlog in this case (you will be required a super user privilege).
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
# sysctl net.core.somaxconn
net.core.somaxconn = 128
# sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn = 256
		</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
You could add following to /etc/sysctl.conf instead.
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
net.core.somaxconn = 256
		</pre>
    </p>
		<p>
    Number of connections to each PostgreSQL is roughly max_pool*num_init_children</p>

    <p>Some hints in addition to above:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Canceling a query creates another
            connection to the backend; thus, a query cannot be canceled if
            all the connections are in use. If you want to ensure that queries can
            be canceled, set this value to twice the expected connections.</li>

        <li>PostgreSQL allows concurrent connections for non superusers up
            to max_connections - superuser_reserved_connections.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In summary, max_pool, num_init_children, max_connections,
    superuser_reserved_connections must satisfy the following formula:
    </p>
<pre>
max_pool*num_init_children &lt;= (max_connections - superuser_reserved_connections) (no query canceling needed)

    in order to make use of the syslog option for log_destination.
    PgPool can log to syslog facilities LOCAL0 through LOCAL7 (see syslog_facility),
    but the default syslog configuration on most platforms will discard all such messages.
    You will need to add something like

    This error check procedure is called "health check".
    If an error is detected, pgpool-II tries to perform failover or degeneration.
    </p>
    <p>
    This parameter serves to prevent the health check from waiting for a long
    time in a case such as unplugged network cable.
    The timeout value is in seconds. Default value is 20.
    0 disables timeout (waits until TCP/IP timeout).
    </p>
    <p>
    This health check requires one extra connection to each backend,
    so <code>max_connections</code> in the

    <dd>
    <p>The maximum number of times to retry a failed health check
    before giving up and initiating failover.
    This setting can be useful in spotty networks, when it is expected that health
    checks will fail occasionally even when the master is fine.
    Default is 0, which means do not retry.
    It is advised that you disable <a href="#FAIL_OVER_ON_BACKEND_ERROR">fail_over_on_backend_error</a>

    <p>
    When a failover is performed, pgpool kills all its child processes, which
    will in turn terminate all active sessions to pgpool. Then pgpool invokes
    the failover_command and waits for its completion.
    After this, pgpool starts new child processes and is ready again to accept

    If follow_master_command is not empty, when a master failover is
    completed in master/slave streaming replication,
    pgpool degenerate all nodes excepted the new master and starts new child processes
    to be ready again to accept connections from clients.
    After this, pgpool run the command set into the 'follow_master_command' for each
    degenerated nodes. Typically the command should be used to recover the slave from the new master

<h3>Backends</h3>

<dl>
<dt><a name="BACKEND_HOSTNAME"></a>backend_hostname</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Specifies where to connect with the PostgreSQL backend.
    It is used by pgpool-II to communicate with the server.
    </p>
    <p>
    For TCP/IP communication, this parameter can take a hostname or an IP address.
    If this begins with a slash, it specifies Unix-domain communication
    rather than TCP/IP; the value is the name of the directory
    in which the socket file is stored. The default behavior when backend_hostname
    is empty (<code>''</code>) is to connect to a Unix-domain socket in <code>/tmp</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Multiple backends can be specified by adding a number at the end
    of the parameter name (e.g.<code>backend_hostname0</code>).
    This number is referred to as "DB node ID", and it starts from 0.
    The backend which was given the DB node ID of 0 will be called "Master DB".
    When multiple backends are defined, the service can be continued
    even if the Master DB is down (not true in some modes).
    In this case, the youngest DB node ID alive will be the new Master DB.</p>
    <p>
    Please note that the DB node which has id 0 has no special meaning
    if operated in streaming replication mode.
    Rather, you should care about if the DB node is the "primary node" or not.
    See <a href="#stream">Streaming Replication</a> for more details.
    </p>
    <p>If you plan to use only one PostgreSQL server, specify it by
    <code>backend_hostname0</code>.</p>

    <p>
    New nodes can be added in this parameter by reloading a configuration
    file. However, values cannot be updated so you must restart pgpool-II in that case.
    </p>
    </dd>

<dt><a name="BACKEND_PORT"></a>backend_port</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Specifies the port number of the backends.

    backends can be specified by adding a number at the end of the
    parameter name (e.g. <code>backend_weight0</code>). If you plan
    to use only one PostgreSQL server, specify it by
    <code>backend_weight0</code>. In the raw mode, set to 1.</p>
    <p>
    New backend weights can be added in this parameter by reloading a configuration file.
    </p>
    <p>
    From pgpool-II 2.2.6/2.3 or later, you can change this value by re-loading the configuration file.
    This will take effect only for new established client sessions.
    This is useful if you want to prevent any query sent to slaves to perform
    some administrative work in master/slave mode.

    <p>Specifies the database cluster directory of the backends.
    Multiple backends can be specified by adding a number
    at the end of the parameter name
    (e.g. <code>backend_data_directory0</code>).
    If you don't plan to use online recovery, you do not need to specify this parameter.

     The relation cache is used for cache the query result against PostgreSQL
     system catalog to obtain various information including table structures
     or if it's a temporary table or not. The cache is maintained in a pgpool
     child local memory and being kept as long as it survives.
     If someone modify the table by using ALTER TABLE or some such, the relcache

<h2 id="failover_in_raw_mode">Failover in the raw Mode</h2>

<p>Failover can be performed in raw mode if multiple servers are
defined. pgpool-II usually accesses the backend specified by
<code>backend_hostname0</code> during normal operation.
If the backend_hostname0 fails for some reason, pgpool-II tries to access the
backend specified by backend_hostname1.
If that fails, pgpool-II tries the backend_hostname2, 3 and so on.</p>

Following parameters take effect to connection pool.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="MAX_POOL"></a>max_pool</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The maximum number of cached connections in pgpool-II children processes.
    pgpool-II reuses the cached connection if an incoming connection is
    connecting to the same database with the same user name.
    If not, pgpool-II creates a new connection to the backend.
    If the number of cached connections exceeds max_pool,
    the oldest connection will be discarded, and uses that slot for the new connection.
    </p>
    <p>
    Default value is 4. Please be aware that the number of
    connections from pgpool-II processes to the backends may reach
    <code><a href="#NUM_INIT_CHILDREN">num_init_children</a></code> *
    <code><a href="#MAX_POOL">max_pool</a></code>.

    <p>When set to true, if all backends don't return the same packet kind,
    the backends that differ from most frequent result set are degenerated.
    </p>
    <p>
    A typical use case is a SELECT statement being part of a transaction,
    <a href="#REPLICATE_SELECT">replicate_select</a> set to true,
    and SELECT returning a different number of rows among backends.
    Non-SELECT statements might trigger this though.
    For example, a backend succeeded in an UPDATE, while others failed.
    Note that pgpool does NOT examine the content of records returned by SELECT.
    </p>
    <p>
    If set to false, the session is terminated and the backends are not degenerated.

    the backends that differ from most frequent result set are degenerated.
    If the frequencies are same, the group which includes master DB node
    (a DB node having the youngest node id) is remained and other groups are degenerated.

    Specify a comma separated list of function names that <strong>do not</strong>

    neither load balanced, nor replicated if in replication mode.
    In master slave mode, such SELECTs are sent to master (primary) only.
    </p>
    <p>You can use regular expression into the list to match function name

    update the database. SELECTs using functions specified in this list are neither
    load balanced, nor replicated if in replication mode.
    In master slave mode, such SELECTs are sent to master(primary) only.
    </p>
    <p>You can use regular expression into the list to match function name

</pre>
    <p>
    Only one of these two lists can be filled in a configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
    Prior to pgpool-II 3.0, nextval() and setval() were known to do
    writes to the database. You can emulate this by using white_function_list and
    black_function_list:
    </p>
<pre>
white_function_list = ''
black_function_list = 'nextval,setval,lastval,currval'
</pre>

    <p>
    Please note that we have lastval and currval in addition to nextval and setval.
    Though lastval() and currval() are not writing functions,
    it is wise to add lastval() and currval() to avoid errors
    in the case when these functions are accidentally load balanced to other DB node.
    Because adding to black_function_list will prevent load balancing.

<dt><a name="INSERT_LOCK"></a>insert_lock</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>If replicating a table with SERIAL data type, the SERIAL column value may differ between the backends.
    This problem is avoidable by locking the table explicitly
    (although, transactions' parallelism will be severely degraded).
    To achieve this, however, the following change must be made:
    </p>
<pre>
INSERT INTO ...
</pre>

    <p>
    to
    </p>

<pre>
BEGIN;
LOCK TABLE ...
INSERT INTO ...
COMMIT;
</pre>

    <p>When <code>insert_lock</code> is true, pgpool-II automatically adds
    the above queries each time an INSERT is executed
    (if already in transaction, it simply adds LOCK TABLE ....).
    </p>
    <p>pgpool-II 2.2 or later, it automatically detects whether the table
    has a SERIAL columns or not, so it will never lock the table if it does not use SERIAL columns.
    </p>
    <p>
    pgpool-II 3.0 series until 3.0.4 uses a row lock against the sequence
    relation, rather than table lock.
    This is intended to minimize lock  conflict with VACUUM (including autovacuum).
    However this will lead to another problem.
    After transaction wraparound happens, row locking against the sequence relation
    causes PostgreSQL internal error
    (more precisely, access error on pg_clog, which keeps transaction status).
    To prevent this, PostgreSQL core developers decided to disallow row locking
    against sequences and this will break pgpool-II of course
    (the &quot;fixed&quot; version of PostgreSQL was released as 9.0.5,
    8.4.9, 8.3.16 and 8.2.22).
    </p>
    <p>
    pgpool-II 3.0.5 or later uses a row lock against pgpool_catalog.insert_lock
    table because new PostgreSQL disallows a row lock against the sequence relation.
    So creating insert_lock table in all databases which are accessed via pgpool-II beforehand is required.
    See <a href="#install">Creating insert_lock table</a> for more details.
    If does not exist insert_lock table, pgpool-II locks the insert target table.
    This behavior is same as pgpool-II 2.2 and 2.3 series.
    If you want to use insert_lock which is compatible with older releases,
    you can specify lock method by configure script.
    See <a href="#install">configure</a> for more details.
    </p>
    <p>
    You might want to have a finer (per statement) control:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>set <code>insert_lock</code> to true, and add <code>/*NO INSERT LOCK*/</code>
            at the beginning of an INSERT statement for which
            you do not want to acquire the table lock.</li>

        <li>set <code>insert_lock</code> to false, and add <code>/*INSERT LOCK*/</code>
            at the beginning of an INSERT statement for which
            you want to acquire the table lock.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    Default value is false. If <code>insert_lock</code> is enabled,
    the regression tests for PostgreSQL 8.0 will fail in transactions,
    privileges, rules, and alter_table. The reason for this is that
    pgpool-II tries to LOCK the VIEW for the rule test, and will
    produce the following error message:</p>

<pre>
! ERROR: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until
end of transaction block
</pre>

    <p>For example, the transactions test tries an INSERT into a table which does not exist,
    and pgpool-II causes PostgreSQL to acquire the lock before that.
    The transaction will be aborted, and the following INSERT statement produces
    the above error message.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
    recovery_2nd_stage_command will receive 4 parameters as follows:

    This parameter specifies recovery timeout in sec. If this timeout is reached,
    pgpool cancels online recovery and accepts connections. 0 means no wait.
    </p>
    <p>
    This parameter can be changed without restarting.
    </p>
    </dd>

<dt><a name="CLIENT_IDLE_LIMIT_IN_RECOVERY"></a>client_idle_limit_in_recovery
    <span class="version">V2.2 -</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p> Similar to client_idle_limit but only takes effect in the second
    stage of recovery. A client being idle for client_idle_limit_in_recovery
    seconds since its last query will get disconnected.
    This is useful for preventing the pgpool recovery from being
    disturbed by a lazy client or if the TCP/IP connection between the client
    and pgpool is accidentally down (a cut cable for instance).
    If set to -1, disconnect the client immediately.
    The default value for client_idle_limit_in_recovery is 0,
    which means the feature is turned off.
    </p>
    <p>
    If your clients are very busy, pgpool-II cannot enter the second stage of
    recovery whatever value of client_idle_limit_in_recovery you may choose.
    In this case, you can set client_idle_limit_in_recovery to -1
    so that pgpool-II immediately disconnects such busy clients before entering the second stage.
    </p>
    <p>
    You need to reload pgpool.conf if you change client_idle_limit_in_recovery.</p>
    </dd>

<dt><a name="LOBJ_LOCK_TABLE"></a>lobj_lock_table <span class="version">V2.2 -</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    This parameter specifies a table name used for large object replication control.
    If it is specified, pgpool will lock the table specified by
    lobj_lock_table and generate a large object id by looking into
    pg_largeobject system catalog and then call lo_create to create the large object.
    This procedure guarantees that pgpool will get the same large object id in all DB
    nodes in replication mode. Please note that PostgreSQL 8.0 or older does not
    have lo_create, thus this feature will not work.
    </p>
    <p>
    A call to the libpq function lo_creat() will trigger this feature. Also
    large object creation through Java API (JDBC driver), PHP
    API (pg_lo_create, or similar API in PHP library such as PDO), and this same
    API in various programming languages are known to use a similar protocol,
    and thus should work.
    </p>
    <p>
    The following large object create operation will not work:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>lo_create of libpq</li>
        <li>Any API of any language using lo_create</li>
        <li>lo_import function in backend</li>
        <li>SELECT lo_create</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    It does not matter what schema lobj_lock_table is stored in, but this table
    should be writable by any user. Here is an example showing how to create such a table:
    </p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE public.my_lock_table ();
GRANT ALL ON public.my_lock_table TO PUBLIC;
</pre>

    <p>
    The table specified by lobj_lock_table must be created beforehand. If
    you create the table in template1, any database created afterward will have it.
    </p>
    <p>
    If lobj_lock_table has empty string(''), the feature is disabled
    (thus large object replication will not work). The default value for
    lobj_lock_table is ''.
    </p>
    </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="condition_for_load_balance">condition for load balancing</h2>
<p>

              </ul>
        </ul>

</ul>

<p>
Note that you could suppress load balancing by inserting arbitrary
comments just in front of the SELECT query:
<pre>
/*REPLICATION*/ SELECT ...

</p>

<p>
<font color="red">
Note: the JDBC driver has an autocommit option. If autocommit is false, the JDBC

<h1><a name="master_slave_mode"></a>Master/Slave Mode</h1>

<p>This mode is used to couple pgpool-II with another master/slave
replication software (like Slony-I and Streaming replication), which is responsible
for doing the actual data replication.
</p>
<p>
Please note that the number of slaves is not necessarily limited to just 1.
Actually you could have up to 127 slaves (0 slaves is allowed).
</p>

DB nodes' information (<a href="#BACKEND_HOSTNAME">backend_hostname</a>,

<a href="#BACKEND_FLAG">backend_flag</a> and <a href="#BACKEND_DATA_DIRECTORY">backend_data_directory</a>
if you need the online recovery functionality) must be set, in the same way as in the replication mode.
In addition to that, set <code><a href="#MASTER_SLAVE_MODE">master_slave_mode</a></code> and
<code><a href="#LOAD_BALANCE_MODE">load_balance_mode</a></code> to true.
</p>
<p>
pgpool-II will then send queries that need to be replicated to the
Master DB, and other queries will be load balanced if possible.
Queries sent to Master DB because they cannot be balanced are of course accounted for in the
load balancing algorithm.</p>


<p>In master/slave mode, DDL and DML for temporary table can be executed on the master node only.
SELECT can be forced to be executed on the master as well,
but for this you need to put a /*NO LOAD BALANCE*/ comment before the SELECT statement.</p>

<p>In the master/slave mode, <code><a href="#REPLICATION_MODE">replication_mode</a></code> must be set
to false, and <code><a href="#MASTER_SLAVE_MODE">master_slave_mode</a></code> to true.</p>

<p>The master/slave mode has a 'master_slave_sub mode'.
The default is 'slony' which is
suitable for Slony-I. You can also set it to 'stream', which should be
set if you want to work with PostgreSQL's built-in replication system
(Streaming Replication).
The sample configuration file for the Slony-I sub-mode is
pgpool.conf.sample-master-slave and the sample for the streaming replication
sub-module is pgpool.conf.sample-stream.
</p>
<p>
Please restart pgpool-II if you change any of the above parameters.
</p>
<p>
You can set <a href="#WHITE_FUNCTION_LIST">white_function_list</a> and
<a href="#BLACK_FUNCTION_LIST">black_function_list</a> to control load
balancing in master/slave mode.
See <a href="#WHITE_FUNCTION_LIST">white_function_list</a> for more details.

<h1><a name="stream"></a>Streaming Replication <span class="version">V3.1 -</span></h1>
<p>
As stated above, pgpool-II can work together with Streaming Replication, which
is available since PostgreSQL 9.0. To use it, enable '<a href="#MASTER_SLAVE_MODE">master_slave_mode</a>' and
set '<a href="#MASTER_SLAVE_SUB_MODE">master_slave_sub_mode</a>' to 'stream'.
pgpool-II assumes that Streaming Replication is used with Hot Standby at present,
which means that the standby database is open read-only.
The following directives can be used with this mode:
</p>
<p>

<dl>
<dt id="DELAY_THRESHOLD">delay_threshold <span class="version">V3.0 -</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    Specifies the maximum tolerated replication delay of the standby against the
    primary server in WAL bytes.
    If the delay exceeds delay_threshold, pgpool-II does not send SELECT queries to
    the standby server anymore. Everything is sent to the primary server
    even if load balance mode is enabled, until the standby has caught-up.
    If delay_threshold is 0 or sr checking is disabled, the delay
    checking is not performed. This check is performed every '<a href=#SR_CHECK_PERIOD">sr_check_period</a>'.
    The default value for delay_threshold is 0.
    </p>
    <p>
    You need to reload pgpool.conf if you change this directive.
    </p>
    </dd>

<dt id="SR_CHECK_PERIOD">sr_check_period <span class="version">V3.1 -</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    This parameter specifies the interval between the streaming replication
    delay checks in seconds. Default is 0, which means the check is disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
    You need to reload pgpool.conf if you change sr_check_period.
    </p>
    </dd>

<dt id="SR_CHECK_USER">sr_check_user <span class="version">V3.1 -</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    The user name to perform streaming replication check. This user must
    exist in all the PostgreSQL backends.
    Otherwise, the check causes an error.
    Note that sr_check_user and sr_check_password are used even sr_check_period is 0.
    To identify the primary server, pgpool-II sends function call request to each backend.
    sr_check_user and sr_check_password are used for this session.
    </p>
    <p>
    You need to reload pgpool.conf if you change sr_check_user.
    </p>
    </dd>

<dt id="SR_CHECK_PASSWORD">sr_check_password <span class="version">V3.1 -</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    The password of the user to perform streaming replication check.
    If no password is required, specify empty string('').
    </p>
    <p>
    You need to reload pgpool.conf if you change sr_check_password.
    </p>
    </dd>

<dt id="LOG_STANDBY_DELAY">log_standby_delay <span class="version">V3.1 -</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    Specifies how to log the replication delay.
    If 'none' is specified, no log is written.
    If 'always', log the delay every time health checking is performed.
    If 'if_over_threshold' is specified, the log is written when the delay
    exceeds <a href="#DELAY_THRESHOLD">delay_threshold</a>.
    The default value for log_standby_delay is 'none'.
    You need to reload pgpool.conf if you change this directive.
    </p>
    <p>
    You could monitor the replication delay by using the "<a href="#pool_status">show pool_status</a>"
    command as well.
    The column name is "standby_delay#"(where '#' should be replaced by DB node id).
    </p>
    </dd>
</dl>


<h2 id="failover_in_stream_mode">Failover with Streaming Replication</h2>
<p>
In master/slave mode with streaming replication, if the primary or standby
node goes down, pgpool-II can be set up to trigger a failover.
Nodes can be detached automatically without further setup.
While doing streaming replication, the standby node checks for the presence of a "trigger file"
and on finding it, the standby stops continuous recovery and goes into read-write mode.
By using this, you can have the standby database take over when the primary goes down.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Caution: If you plan to use multiple standby nodes, we recommend
to set a <a href="#DELAY_THRESHOLD">delay_threshold</a> to prevent any query directed to other standby
nodes from retrieving older data.
</p>
<p>
If a second standby took over primary when the first standby has already
taken over too, you would get bogus data from the second standby.
We recommend not to plan this kind of configuration.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
How to setup a failover configuration is as follows.
</p>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Put a failover script somewhere (for example /usr/local/pgsql/bin) and give it execute permission.
<pre>
$ cd /usr/loca/pgsql/bin
$ cat failover_stream.sh
#! /bin/sh
# Failover command for streaming replication.
# This script assumes that DB node 0 is primary, and 1 is standby.
#
# If standby goes down, do nothing. If primary goes down, create a
# trigger file so that standby takes over primary node.
#
# Arguments: $1: failed node id. $2: new master hostname. $3: path to
# trigger file.

failed_node=$1
new_master=$2
trigger_file=$3

# Do nothing if standby goes down.
if [ $failed_node = 1 ]; then
    exit 0;
fi

# Create the trigger file.
/usr/bin/ssh -T $new_master /bin/touch $trigger_file

exit 0;

chmod 755 failover_stream.sh
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Set <a href="#FAILOVER_COMMAND">failover_commmand</a> in pgpool.conf.
<pre>
failover_command = '/usr/local/src/pgsql/9.0-beta/bin/failover_stream.sh %d %H /tmp/trigger_file0'
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Set recovery.conf on the standby node.
    <a href="recovery.conf.sample">A sample recovery.conf</a> can be found
    under the PostgreSQL installation directory. Its name is
    "share/recovery.conf.sample".
    Copy recovery.conf.sample as recovery.conf inside the database cluster directory and edit it.
<pre>
standby_mode = 'on'
primary_conninfo = 'host=name of primary_host user=postgres'
trigger_file = '/tmp/trigger_file0'
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Set postgresql.conf on the primary node.
    Below is just an example. You will need to tweak it for your environment.
<pre>
wal_level = hot_standby
max_wal_senders = 1
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Set pg_hba.conf on the primary node.
    Below is just an example. You will need to tweak it for your environment.
<pre>
host    replication    postgres        192.168.0.10/32        trust
</pre>
    </li>

</ol>

<p>
Start primary and secondary PostgreSQL nodes to initiate Streaming replication.
If the primary node goes down, the standby node will automatically start as a normal PostgreSQL
and will be ready to accept write queries.
</p>

<h2 id="load_balance_in_stream_mode">Streaming Replication</h2>
<p>
While using Streaming replication and Hot Standby, it is important to
determine which query can be sent to the primary or the standby,
and which one should not be sent to the standby.
pgpool-II's Streaming Replication mode carefully takes care of this.
In this chapter we'll explain how pgpool-II accomplishes this.
</p>
<p>
We distinguish which query should be sent to which node by looking
at the query itself.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>These queries should be sent to the primary node only
    <ul>
       <li>INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, COPY FROM, TRUNCATE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, COMMENT</li>
       <li>SELECT ... FOR SHARE | UPDATE</li>
       <li>SELECT in transaction isolation level SERIALIZABLE</li>
       <li>LOCK command more strict than ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE</li>
       <li>Some transactional commands:
           <ul>
               <li>BEGIN READ WRITE, START TRANSACTION READ WRITE</li>
               <li>SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE, SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION READ WRITE</li>
               <li>SET transaction_read_only = off</li>
           </ul>
       </li>
       <li>Two phase commit commands: PREPARE TRANSACTION, COMMIT PREPARED, ROLLBACK PREPARED</li>
       <li>LISTEN, UNLISTEN, NOTIFY</li>
       <li>VACUUM</li>
       <li>Some sequence functions (nextval and setval)</li>
       <li>Large objects creation commands</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>These queries can be sent to both the primary node and the standby node.
    If load balancing is enabled, these types of queries can be sent to the standby node.
    However, if delay_threshold is set and the replication delay is higher than
    <a href="#DELAY_THRESHOLD">delay_threshold</a>, queries are sent to the primary node.
    <ul>
       <li>SELECT not listed above</li>
       <li>COPY TO</li>
       <li>DECLARE, FETCH, CLOSE</li>
       <li>SHOW</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

   <li>These queries are sent to both the primary node and the standby node
   <ul>
       <li>SET</li>
       <li>DISCARD</li>
       <li>DEALLOCATE ALL</li>
   </ul>
   </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In an explicit transaction:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Transaction starting commands such as BEGIN are sent to the primary node.
    <li>Following SELECT and some other queries that can be sent to both
        primary or standby are executed in the transaction or on the standby node.
    </li>
    <li>
        Commands which cannot be executed on the standby such as INSERT are sent
        to the primary.
        After one of these commands, even SELECTs are sent to the primary node,
        This is because these SELECTs might want to see the result of an INSERT immediately.
        This behavior continues until the transaction closes or aborts.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
In the extended protocol, it is possible to determine if the query can
be sent to standby or not in load balance mode while parsing the query.
The rules are the same as for the non extended protocol.
For example, INSERTs are sent to the primary node.
Following bind, describe and execute will be sent to the primary node as well.
</p>

<p>
[Note: If the parse of a SELECT statement is sent to the standby node due to load
balancing, and then a DML statement, such as an INSERT, is sent to pgpool-II,
then the parsed SELECT will have to be executed on the primary node.
Therefore, we re-parse the SELECT on the primary node.]
</p>

<p>
Lastly, queries that pgpool-II's parser thinks to be an error are sent to the
primary node.
</p>

<p>
You can use database name and application name for smaller granularity
in specifying load balance.
</p>

<p>
<dl>
  <dt id="DATABASE_REDIRECT_PREFERENCE_LIST">database_redirect_preference_list <span class="version">V3.4 〜</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
	  you can set "database name:node id" pair to specify the node id when connecting to the database.
	  For example, by specifying "test:1",  pgpool-II always redirects SELECT to node 1 in case of connecting to database "test".
	  You can specify multiple "database name:node id" pair by separating them using comma (,).
	  Regular expressions are accepted for database name.
	  Special keyword "primary" indicates the primary node and "standby" indicates one of standby nodes.
    </p>
	<p>
	  Here is an example.
	<pre>
database_redirect_preference_list = 'postgres:primary,mydb[01]:1,mydb2:standby'
	</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
	  SELECTs will be redirected to primary if you connect to postgres database.
	  Connecting to mydb0 or mydb1 will redirect SELECTs to node 1.
	  Connecting to mydb2 will redirect SELECTs to one of standby nodes.
	</p>
    <p>
    You need to reload pgpool.conf if you change this directive.
    </p>
    </dd>

  <dt id="APP_NAME_REDIRECT_PREFERENCE_LIST">app_name_redirect_preference_list <span class="version">V3.4 〜</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
	  you can set "application name:node id" pair to specify the node id when the application is used.
	  "Application name" is a name specified by a client when it connects to database.
	You can use it in PostgreSQL 9.0 or later.
	  For example, application of psql command is "psql".
	  pgpool-II recognize application names only when clients sends a start up packet.
	  Clients can send application names later on but pgpool-II will not recognize them.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The notion of app_name_redirect_preference_list is same as database_redirect_preference_list.
	  Thus you can use regular expressions for application name.
    </p>
	<p>
	  Here is an example.
	<pre>
app_name_redirect_preference_list = 'psql:primary,myapp1:1,myapp2:standby'
	</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
	  In this example, psql sends SELECTs to primary node, myapp1 sends to node 1, and myapp2 sends to one of standby nodes.
	</p>
	<p>
	  app_name_redirect_preference_list takes precedence over database_redirect_preference_list.
	  See the next example.
	  <pre>
		database_redirect_preference_list = 'bigdb:primary'
		app_name_redirect_preference_list = 'myapp:2'
	  </pre>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Applications connecting to bigdb database send SELECTs to primary node.
	  However myapp sends SELECTs to node 2 even if it connects to bigdb.
	  This is useful in a scenario: myapp2 sends very heavy SELECTs to execute analysis jobs.
	  You want to use node 2 solely for analysis purpose.
	</p>
    <p>
    You need to reload pgpool.conf if you change this directive.

<h2 id="online_recovery_in_stream_mode">Online recovery with Streaming Replication</h2>
<p>
In master/slave mode with streaming replication, online recovery can be performed.
In the online recovery procedure, primary server acts as a master server and recovers specified standby server.
Thus the recovery procedure requires that the primary server is up and running.
If the primary server goes down, and no standby server is promoted, you need to stop
pgpool-II and all PostgreSQL servers and recover them manually.
</p>

<p>
<ol>
    <li>Set <a href="#RECOVERY_USER">recovery_user</a>. Usually it's "postgres".
<pre>
recovery_user = 'postgres'
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Set <a href="#RECOVERY_PASSWORD">recovery_password</a> for
    <a href="#RECOVERY_USER">recovery_user</a> to login database.
<pre>
recovery_password = 't-ishii'
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Set <a href="#RECOVERY_1ST_STAGE_COMMAND">recovery_1st_stage_command</a>.
    The script for this stage should perform a base backup of the primary and
    restore it on the standby node.
    Place this script inside the primary database cluster directory and give it
    execute permission.
    Here is the sample script <a href="basebackup.sh">(basebackup.sh)</a> for
    a configuration of one primary and one standby.
    You need to setup ssh so that recovery_user can login from the primary to
    the standby without being asked for a password.
<pre>
recovery_1st_stage_command = 'basebackup.sh'
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Leave <a href="#RECOVERY_2ND_STAGE_COMMAND">recovery_2nd_stage_command</a> be empty.
<pre>
recovery_2nd_stage_command = ''
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Install required C and SQL functions to perform online recovery into each DB nodes.</li>
</p>

<pre>
# cd pgpool-II-x.x.x/sql/pgpool-recovery
# make
# make install
# psql -f pgpool-recovery.sql template1
</pre>

    <li>After completing online recovery, pgpool-II will start PostgreSQL on
    the standby node.
    Install the script for this purpose on each DB nodes.
    <a href="pgpool_remote_start">Sample script</a> is included in "sample"
    directory of the source code.
    This script uses ssh. You need to allow recovery_user to login from the

    </li>
</ol>


<p>
That's it.
Now you should be able to use <a href="#pcp_recovery_node">pcp_recovery_node</a> (as long as the standby
node stops) or push "recovery" button of pgpoolAdmin to perform online recovery.
If something goes wrong, please examine pgpool-II log, primary server log and standby server log(s).
</p>

<p>
For your reference, here are the steps taken in the recovery procedure.
<ol id="setting_for_online_recovery_in_stream_mode">
    <li>Pgpool-II connects to primary server's template1 database

    </li>
    <li>Primary server executes pgpool_recovery function.
    </li>
    <li>pgpool_recovery function executes <a href="#RECOVERY_1ST_STAGE_COMMAND">recovery_1st_stage_command</a>.
        Note that PostgreSQL executes functions with database cluster as the current directory.
        Thus recovery_1st_stage_command is executed in the database cluster directory.

    <li>Primary server executes <a href="#pool_remote_start">pgpool_remote_start</a> function.
        This function executes a script named "pgpool_remote_start" in the database cluster directory,
        and it executes pg_ctl command on the standby server to be recovered via ssh.
        pg_ctl will start postmaster in background.
        So we need to make sure that postmaster on the standby actually starts.
    </li>
    <li>pgpool-II tries to connect to the standby PostgreSQL
        as user = <a href="#RECOVERY_USER">recovery_user</a> and
        password = <a href="#RECOVERY_PASSWORD">recovery_password</a>.
        The database to be connected is "postgres" if possible. Otherwise "template1" is used.
        pgpool-II retries for <a href="#RECOVERY_TIMEOUT">recovery_timeout</a> seconds.
        If success, go to next step.
    </li>
    <li>If <a href="#FAILBACK_COMMAND">failback_command</a> is not empty,

<p class="version_notice">
  <em class="caution">DEPRECATED</em> :
  This mode is deprecated and will be removed in the future release (possibly 3.5).
</p>

<p>This mode activates parallel execution of queries.

<h2 id="system_db">Configuring the System DB</h2>

<p>To use the parallel mode, the System DB must be configured
properly. The System DB contains rules, stored in a table, to choose an

<pre>

<h3 id="distdef">Registering a Partitioning Rule</h3>

<p>The rules for data partitioning must be registered into the
<code>pgpool_catalog.dist_def</code> table.</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE pgpool_catalog.dist_def(
    dbname TEXT,                                              -- database name

</pre>


<h3 id="replicate_def">Registering a Replication Rule</h3>
<p>
Tables that are not distributed have to be replicated. When a query joins a
distributed table with another table, pgpool gets the replication information
from the pgpool_catalog.replicate_def table. A table has to be either replicated
or distributed.
</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE pgpool_catalog.replicate_def(
    dbname TEXT,                  -- database name

    PRIMARY KEY (dbname,schema_name,table_name)
);
</pre>

<h2 id="example_partitioning">Example for partitioning the pgbench tables</h2>

<p>
In this example, the accounts table is partitioned, and the branches and tellers
table are replicated.
The accounts table and the branches table are joined by bid.
The branches table is registered into the replication table.
If the three tables (accounts, branches, and tellers)
are to be joined, it is necessary to register a replication rule for
the tellers table too.
</p>
<pre>
INSERT INTO pgpool_catalog.dist_def VALUES (
    'pgpool',
    'public',
    'accounts',
    'aid',
    ARRAY['aid','bid','abalance','filler'],
    ARRAY['integer','integer','integer','character(84)'],

<p>The partitioning rule function (here,
pgpool_catalog.dist_def_accounts) takes a value for the partitioning

<h1><a name="hba"></a>Setting up pool_hba.conf for client authentication (HBA)</h1>
<p>
Just like the pg_hba.conf file for PostgreSQL, pgpool supports a similar
client authentication function using a configuration file called  "pool_hba.conf".
</p>
<p>
When you install pgpool, pool_hba.conf.sample will be installed in
"/usr/local/etc", which is the default directory for configuration
files. Copy pool_hba.conf.sample as pool_hba.conf and edit it if necessary.
By default, pool_hba authentication is disabled.
Change <a href="#ENABLE_POOL_HBA">enable_pool_hba</a> to on to enable it.
</p>
<p>
The format of the pool_hba.conf file follows very closely PostgreSQL's
pg_hba.conf format.
</p>
<pre>
local      DATABASE  USER  METHOD  [OPTION]
host       DATABASE  USER  CIDR-ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTION]
</pre>
<p>
See "pool_hba.conf.sample" for a detailed explanation of each field.
</p>
<p>
Here are the limitations of pool_hba.
</p>

<ul>
<li>"samegroup" for DATABASE field is not supported</li>
    <p>
    Since pgpool does not know anything about users in the backend server,
    the database name is simply checked against entries in the DATABASE
    field of pool_hba.conf.
    </p>

<li>group names following "+" for USER field is not supported</li>
    <p>
    This is for the same reason as for the "samegroup" described above. A
    user name is simply checked against the entries in the USER field
    of pool_hba.conf.
    </p>

<li>IPv6 for IP address/mask is not supported</li>
    <p>
    pgpool currently does not support IPv6.
    </p>

<li>Only "trust", "reject", "md5" and "pam" for METHOD field are supported</li>
    <p>
    Again, this is for the same reason as for the "samegroup" described above.
    pgpool does not have access to user/password information.
    </p>
    <p>
    To use md5 authentication, you need to register your name and password in "pool_passwd".
    See <a href="#md5">Authentication / Access Controls</a> for more details.
</ul>

<p>
Note that everything described in this section is about the authentication
taking place between a client and pgpool;
a client still has to go through the PostgreSQL's authentication process.
As far as pool_hba is concerned, it does not matter if a user name and/or database name
given by a client (i.e. psql -U testuser testdb) really exists in the backend.
pool_hba only cares if a match in the pool_hba.conf is found or not.
</p>

<p>
PAM authentication is supported using user information on the host where
pgpool is executed. To enable PAM support in pgpool, specify "--with-pam"
option to configure:
</p>
<pre>
configure --with-pam
</pre>
<p>
To enable PAM authentication, you need to create a
service-configuration file for pgpool in the system's PAM
configuration directory (which is usually at "/etc/pam.d").
A sample service-configuration file is installed as "share/pgpool.pam" under the install directory.

<h1 id="query_cache">Setting Query cache method <span class="version">- V3.4 (REMOVED)</span></h1>

<strong>Caution: this (on disk) query cache functionality is removed from V3.4.
Please use <a href="#memqcache">in memory query cache</a> instead.
</strong>

<p>The Query cache can be used in all modes in pgpool-II.
The query cache allow to reuse the SELECT result to boost the performance.
Activating it in pgpool.conf is done as follows:</p>
<pre>
enable_query_cache = true
</pre>

<p>
You'll have to create the following table in the System DB too:
</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE pgpool_catalog.query_cache (
  hash TEXT,
  query TEXT,
  value bytea,
  dbname TEXT,
  create_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  PRIMARY KEY(hash, dbname)
);
</pre>
<p>
However, you may have to modify the schema in this statement, if you don't use
"pgpool_catalog".
</p>
<p>
<strong>Caution: Current query cache implementation creates cache data on database.
Thus enabling query cache may not contribute to boost performance.
Contents of query cache is not updated even if the underlying table is get updated.
You need to delete the cache data from the cache table or restart pgpool-II with -c (delete cache) option.
</strong>
</p>

<p class="top_link"><a href="#Top">back to top</a></p>

<!-- ================================================================================ -->

<h1><a name="memqcache"></a>In memory query Cache <span class="version">V3.2 -</span></h1>

<p>
You can use in memory query cache in any mode.
It is different from the above query cache on the point that
in memory query cache is faster because cache storage is in memory.
Moreover you don't need to restart pgpool-II when the cache is outdated
because the underlying table gets updated.
</p>

<p>
In memory cache saves pair of SELECT statements
(with its Bind parameters if the SELECT is an extended query).
If the same SELECTs comes in, it returns the value from cache.
Since no SQL parsing nor access to PostgreSQL are involved, it's extremely fast.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it might be slower than the normal path because it adds some overhead to store cache.
Moreover when a table is updated, pgpool automatically deletes all the caches related to the table.
So the performance will be degraded by a system with a lot of updates.
If the cache_hit_ratio is lower than 70%, you might want to disable in memory cache.
</p>

<h2 id="MEMORY_CACHE_RESTRICTIONS">Restrictions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
    In memory query cache deletes the all cache of an updated table automatically
    with monitoring if the executed query is UPDATE, INSERT, ALTER TABLE and so on.
    But pgpool-II isn't able to recognize implicit updates due to triggers, foreign keys and
    DROP TABLE CASCADE.
    You can avoid this problem with <a href="#MEMQCACHE_EXPIRE">memqcache_expire</a>
    by which pgpool deletes old cache in a fixed time automatically, or with
    <a href="#BLACK_MEMQCACHE_TABLE_LIST">black_memqcache_table_list</a>
    by which pgpool's memory cache flow ignores the tables.
    </li>

    <li>
    If you want to use multiple instances of pgpool-II with online memory cache which uses shared memory,
    it could happen that one pgpool deletes cache,
    and the other one doesn't do it thus finds old cached result when a table gets updated.
    Memcached is the better cache storage in this case.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED">Enabling in memory query cache</h2>
<p>
To enable the memory cache functionality, set this to on (default is off).
</p>

<pre>
memory_cache_enabled = on
</pre>

<h2 id="MEMQCACHE_METHOD">Choosing cache storage</h2>
<p>
You can choose a cache storage: shared memory or <a href="http://memcached.org">memcached</a>
(you can't use the both).
Query cache with shared memory is fast and easy because you don't have to install and configure memcached,
but restricted the max size of cache by the one of shared memory.
Query cache with memcached needs a overhead to access network, but you can set the size as you like.
</p>
<p>
Memory cache behavior can be specified by memqcache_method directive.
Either "shmem"(shared memory) or "memcached". Default is shmem.
</p>
<pre>
memqcache_method = 'shmem'
</pre>


<h2 id="memqcache_cases">When in memory query cache is prohibited</h2>
<p>

Not All of SELECTs and WITH can be cached. In some cases including followings,
cache is avoided to keep consistency between caches and databases.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>SELECT starting with "/*NO QUERY CACHE*/" comment</li>
    <li>SELECT including tables in <a href="#BLACK_MEMQCACHE_TABLE_LIST">black_memqcache_table_list</a></li>
    <li>SELECT FOR SHARE / UPDATE</li>
    <li>SELECT including un-immutable functions</li>
    <li>SELECT including TEMP TABLE</li>
    <li>SELECT including system catalogs</li>
    <li>SELECT including VIEWs or unlogged tables.
        However if the table is in <a href="#WHITE_MEMQCACHE_TABLE_LIST">white_memqcache_table_list</a>, the result will be cached.</li>

    <li>SELECT including VIEWs</li>
    <li>SELECT in an aborted explicit transaction</li>
    <li>SELECT with the result larger than <a href="#MEMQCACHE_MAXCACHE">memqcache_maxcache</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non_memqcache_case">When cache is not used</h2>
<p>
It can happen that even if the matched query cache exists, pgpool doesn't return it.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If an updating query is executed in an explicit transaction, during the transaction,
        pgpool doesn't use any query cache.</li>
    <li>The matched query cache is made by the other user (for security reason)</li>
    <li>The matched query cache has to be deleted due to <a href="#MEMQCACHE_EXPIRE">memqcache_expire</a>.</li>

</pre>
        <p>
        To avoid this problem, you have to set memqcache_maxcache larger.

    Specify the number of cache entries.
    This is used to define the size of cache management space
    (you need this in addition to <a href="#MEMQCACHE_TOTAL_SIZE">memqcache_total_size</a>).
    The management space size can be calculated by:
    <a href="#MEMQCACHE_MAX_NUM_CACHE">memqcache_max_num_cache</a> * 48 bytes.
    Too small number will cause an error while registering cache.
    On the other hand too large number is just a waste of space.

    <p>
    If cache storage is shared memory, pgpool uses the memory divided by memqcache_cache_block_size.
    SELECT result is packed into the block.
    However because the SELECT result cannot be placed in several blocks, it cannot be cached if it is larger
    than memqcache_cache_block_size.
    memqcache_cache_block_size must be greater or equal to 512.

<h3 id="install_memcached">memcached Installation</h3>

<p>
To use memcached as cache storage, pgpool-II needs a working memcached and
the client library: libmemcached.
It is easy to install them by rpms. This explains how to install from source codes.
</p>

<p>
memcached's source code can be downloaded from:
<a href="http://memcached.org/">memcached development page</a>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>configure</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    After extracting the source tarball, execute the configure script.

<h2 id="stop_pgpool">Stop pgpool-II</h2>

<p>
There are two ways to stop pgpool-II. One is using a PCP command
(described later), the other using a pgpool-II command. Below is an example of the
pgpool-II command.
</p>

<pre>
pgpool [-f config_file][-F pcp_config_file] [-m {s[mart]|f[ast]|i[mmediate]}] stop
</pre>

<table border>
  <tr><td><code>-m s[mart]</code></td><td><code>--mode s[mart]</code></td>
      <td>waits for clients to disconnect, and shutdown (default)</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>-m f[ast]</code></td><td><code>--mode f[ast]</code></td>
      <td>does not wait for clients; shutdown immediately</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>-m i[mmediate]</code></td><td><code>--mode i[mmediate]</code></td>
      <td>the same as <code>'-m f'</code></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
pgpool records backend status into the [logdir]/pgpool_status file.
From pgpool-II 3.4.0 the file format of pgpool_status has been changed: it's an ordinary ASCII file and you can read and edit the contents by using your favorite text editor.
For example, if you add new backend and restart pgpool-II, you might have wait for long time until pgpool-II detects the new backend and performs failover.
By editing pgpool_status to set the backend to be down status, you could avoid the situation because pgpool-II's health check skips down nodes.
Each line in the file corresponding to each backend node status.
The first backend status is the first line, and and the seconds backend status is the second line and so on.
The backend status is represented by any of "up", "down", "unused" (case ignored).
Here is an example of pgpool_status:
<pre>
up
down
up
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Note that pre-3.4.0 pgpool-II uses binary format pgpool_status. Pgpool-II 3.4.0 or later can read the file as well. However pre-3.4.0 pgpool-II cannot read ASCII format pgpool_status file.
</p>

<p>
When pgpool
restarts, it reads this file and restores the backend status. This will prevent
a difference in data among DB nodes which might be caused by following scenario:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>A backend suddenly stops and pgpool executes the fail over procedure</li>
    <li>An update occurs on one of the active DBs through pgpool</li>
    <li>The administrator decides to stop pgpool</li>
    <li>Someone decides to restart the stopping DB without notifying the admin</li>
    <li>The administrator restarts pgpool</li>
</ol>

<p>
If for some reason, for example, the stopped DB has been synced with the
active DB by another means, pgpool_status can be removed safely before
starting pgpool.
</p>

<h1>Reloading pgpool-II configuration files<a name="reload"></a></h1>
<p>pgpool-II can reload configuration files without restarting.
</p>

<pre>
pgpool [-c][-f config_file][-a hba_file][-F pcp_config_file] reload
</pre>

<p>
Please note that some configuration items cannot be changed by
reloading. New configuration takes effect after a change for new sessions.

<h1><a name="show-commands"></a>SHOW commands</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
pgpool-II provides some information via the SHOW command. SHOW is a real SQL
statement, but pgPool-II intercepts this command if it asks for specific
pgPool-II information. Available options are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>pool_status, to get the configuration</li>
  <li>pool_nodes, to get the nodes information <span class="version">V3.0 -</span></li>
  <li>pool_processes, to get information on pgPool-II processes <span class="version">V3.0 -</span></li>
  <li>pool_pools, to get information on pgPool-II pools <span class="version">V3.0 -</span></li>
  <li>pool_version, to get the pgPool_II release version <span class="version">V3.0 -</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Other than "pool_status" are added since pgpool-II 3.0.
<p>
<u>Note</u> : The term 'pool' refers to the pool of PostgreSQL sessions owned by one pgpool process,
not the whole sessions owned by pgpool.
</p>
</p>
<p>the "pool_status" SQL statement was already available in previous releases,
but the other ones have appeared in release 3.0.</p>

<h1><a name="online-recovery"></a>Online Recovery</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
pgpool-II, while in replication mode, can sync a database and attach a node
while still servicing clients. We call this feature "online recovery".
</p>

<p>
A recovery target node must be in the detached state before doing online
recovery.

If you wish to add a PostgreSQL server dynamically, add 'backend_hostname' and
its associated parameters and reload pgpool.conf. pgpool-II registers this new
node as a detached node.
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">caution: Stop autovacuum on the master node (the
first node which is up and running). Autovacuum may change the contents
of the database and might cause inconsistency after online recovery if
it's running. This applies only if you're recovering with a simple copy mechanism, such
as the rsync one explained below. This doesn't apply if you're using PostgreSQL's
PITR mechanism.</font>
</p>

<p>
   If the target PostgreSQL server has already started, you need to shut it down.
</p>

<p>
pgpool-II performs online recovery in two separated phases. There are a few
seconds or minutes when client will be waiting to connect to pgpool-II while a
recovery node synchronizes database. It follows these steps:
</p>

<ol>
    <li> CHECKPOINT</li>
    <li> First stage of online recovery</li>
    <li> Wait until all clients have disconnected</li>
    <li> CHECKPOINT</li>
    <li> Second stage of online recovery</li>
    <li> Start up postmaster (perform <a href="#pool_remote_start">pgpool_remote_start</a>)</li>
    <li> Node attach</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first step of data synchronization is called "first stage". Data is
synchronized during the first stage. In the first stage, data <b>can</b> be
updated or retrieved from any table concurrently.
</p>

<p>
You can specify a script executed during the first stage. pgpool-II
passes three arguments to the script.
</p>

<ol>
    <li> The database cluster path of a master node.</li>
    <li> The hostname of a recovery target node.</li>
    <li> The database cluster path of a recovery target node.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Data synchronization is finalized during what is called "second stage".
Before entering the second stage, pgpool-II waits until all clients have disconnected.
It blocks any new incoming connection until the second stage is over.
</p>
<p>
After all connections have terminated, pgpool-II merges updated data between
the first stage and the second stage. This is the final data
synchronization step.
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">
Note that there is a restriction about online recovery. If pgpool-II itself
is installed on multiple hosts, online recovery does not work correctly,
because pgpool-II has to stop all clients during the 2nd stage of
online recovery. If there are several pgpool hosts, only one will have received
the online recovery command and will block connections.
</font>
</p>

<h2 id="online_recovery_params">Configuration for online recovery</h2>
<p>
Set the following parameters for online recovery in pgpool.conf.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#BACKEND_DATA_DIRECTORY">backend_data_directory</a></li>
    <li><a href="#RECOVERY_USER">recovery_user</a></li>
    <li><a href="#RECOVERY_PASSWORD">recovery_password</a></li>
    <li><a href="#RECOVERY_1ST_STAGE_COMMAND">recovery_1st_stage_command</a></li>
    <li><a href="#RECOVERY_2ND_STAGE_COMMAND">recovery_2nd_stage_command</a></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="installing-c-functions"></a>Installing C language functions</h2>
<p>
You need to install the following C language function for online recovery into
the "template1" database of all backend nodes.

Its source code is in pgpool-II tarball.
</p>

<pre>
pgpool-II-x.x.x/sql/pgpool-recovery/
</pre>

<p>
Change directory there and do "make install".
</p>

<pre>
% cd pgpool-II-x.x.x/sql/pgpool-recovery/
% make install
</pre>

<p>
Then, install the SQL function.
</p>

<pre>
% cd pgpool-II-x.x.x/sql/pgpool-recovery/
% psql -f pgpool-recovery.sql template1
</pre>


<h2 id="recovery_script">Recovery script deployment </h2>
<p>
We must deploy some data sync scripts and a remote start script into
the database cluster directory ($PGDATA). Sample script files are available in
pgpool-II-x.x.x/sample directory.
</p>

<h3 id="recovery_pitr">Online recovery by PITR</h3>
<p>
Here is how to do online recovery by Point In Time Recovery (PITR), which is
available in PostgreSQL 8.2 and later versions.
Note that all PostgreSQL servers involved need to have PITR enabled.
</p>

<h4>1st stage</h4>

<p>
A script to get a base backup on a master node and copy it to a
recovery target node on the first stage is needed. The script can be named
"copy-base-backup" for example. Here is the sample script.
</p>

<pre>
#! /bin/sh
DATA=$1
RECOVERY_TARGET=$2
RECOVERY_DATA=$3

psql -c "select pg_start_backup('pgpool-recovery')" postgres
echo "restore_command = 'scp $HOSTNAME:/data/archive_log/%f %p'" &gt; /data/recovery.conf
tar -C /data -zcf pgsql.tar.gz pgsql
psql -c 'select pg_stop_backup()' postgres
scp pgsql.tar.gz $RECOVERY_TARGET:$RECOVERY_DATA
</pre>

<p>
This script puts the master database in backup mode, generates the following recovery.conf:
</p>
<pre>
restore_command = 'scp master:/data/archive_log/%f %p'
</pre>

<p>
performs the backup, then puts the master database out of backup mode and copies
the backup on the chosen target node.
</p>

<h4>2nd stage</h4>

<p>
The second stage of the procedure is a script to force an XLOG file switch.
This script is named "pgpool_recovery_pitr" here.
It enforces a switch of the transaction log.
For this purpose, pg_switch_xlog could be used.
</p>
<p><span class="version">V3.1 -</span>
However it may return <b>before</b> the switch is done and this might lead to
failure of the online recovery procedure.
Pgpool-II provides a safer function called "pgpool_switch_xlog" which will wait
until the transaction log switching is actually finished.
pgpool_switch_xlog is installed during the procedure performed in the
<a href="#installing-c-functions">Installing C functions</a> section.
</p>

<p>
Here is the sample script.
</p>
<pre>
#! /bin/sh
# Online recovery 2nd stage script
#
datadir=$1       # master dabatase cluster
DEST=$2          # hostname of the DB node to be recovered
DESTDIR=$3       # database cluster of the DB node to be recovered
port=5432        # PostgreSQL port number
archdir=/data/archive_log    # archive log directory

# Force to flush current value of sequences to xlog
psql -p $port -t -c 'SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE NOT datistemplate AND datallowconn' template1|
while read i
do
  if [ "$i" != "" ];then
    psql -p $port -c "SELECT setval(oid, nextval(oid)) FROM pg_class WHERE relkind = 'S'" $i
  fi
done

psql -p $port -c "SELECT pgpool_switch_xlog('$archdir')" template1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This flushing of sequences is only useful in replication mode: in this case, sequences have to have the
same starting point on all nodes. It's not useful in master-slave mode.
</p>
<p>
The loop in the script forces PostgreSQL to emit current value of all sequences
in all databases in the master node to the transaction log so that it is
propagated to the recovery target node.

<p>
We deploy these scripts into the $PGDATA directory.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we edit pgpool.conf.
</p>

<pre>
recovery_1st_stage_command = 'copy-base-backup'
recovery_2nd_stage_command = 'pgpool_recovery_pitr'
</pre>

<p>
We have finished preparing online recovery by PITR.
</p>

<h4 id="pool_remote_start">pgpool_remote_start</h4>
<p>
This script starts up the remote host's postmaster process.
pgpool-II executes it the following way.
</p>

<pre>
% pgpool_remote_start remote_host remote_datadir
remote_host:    Hostname of a recovery target.
remote_datadir: Database cluster path of a recovery target.
</pre>

<p>
In this sample script, we start up the postmaster process over ssh.
So you need to be able to connect over ssh without a password for it to work.
</p>

<p>
If you recover with PITR, you need to deploy a base backup. PostgreSQL will
automatically start up doing a PITR recovery. Then it will accept connections.
</p>

<pre>
#! /bin/sh
DEST=$1
DESTDIR=$2
PGCTL=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl

# Deploy a base backup
ssh -T $DEST 'cd /data/; tar zxf pgsql.tar.gz' 2&gt;/dev/null 1&gt;/dev/null &lt; /dev/null
# Startup PostgreSQL server
ssh -T $DEST $PGCTL -w -D $DESTDIR start 2&gt;/dev/null 1&gt;/dev/null &lt; /dev/null &amp;
</pre>

<h3 id="recovery_rsync">Online recovery with rsync.</h3>
<p>
PostgreSQL 7.4 does not have PITR.
PostgreSQL 8.0 and 8.1 cannot force to switch transaction log.
So rsync can be used to do online recovery.
In the "sample" directory of pgpool-II's tarball,
there is a recovery script named "pgpool_recovery". It uses the rsync
command. pgpool-II calls the script with three arguments.
</p>

<pre>
% pgpool_recovery datadir remote_host remote_datadir
datadir:        Database cluster path of a master node.
remote_host:    Hostname of a recovery target node.
remote_datadir: Database cluster path of a recovery target node.
</pre>

<p>
This script copies physical files with rsync over ssh. So you need to
be able to connect over ssh without a password.
</p>

<p>
Note about rsync:
<ul>
    <li>-c (or --checksum) option is required to enable reliable file tranmitting
    </li>
    <li>-z (or --compress) option does compression before transmitting data.
        This will be great for slower connection, but it might add too much
        CPU overhead for a 100Mbit or faster connections. In this case you
        might want not to use this option.
    </li>
    <li>rsync 3.0.5 has great speed performance
        improvements (50% faster according to a report from pgpool-general mailing list.
    </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
If you use pgpool_recovery, add the following lines into pgpool.conf.
</p>

<pre>
recovery_1st_stage_command = 'pgpool_recovery'
recovery_2nd_stage_command = 'pgpool_recovery'
</pre>

<h2 id="perform_online_recovery">How to perform online recovery</h2>
<p>
In order to do online recovery, use the <a href="pcp_recovery_node">pcp_recovery_node</a> command or
pgpoolAdmin.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to pass a large number to the first argument of
<a href="#pcp_recovery_node">pcp_recovery_node</a>. It is the timeout parameter in seconds. If you use
pgpoolAdmin, set "_PGPOOL2_PCP_TIMEOUT " parameter to a large number in
pgmgt.conf.php.
</p>

<h2 id="minorup_w_online_recovery">PostgreSQL version up using online recovery</h2>
<h3>replication mode case</h3>
<p>
You can update PostgreSQL on each node without stopping pgpool-II if pgpool-II operated in replication mode.
Please note that active sessions from clients to pgpool-II will be disconnected
while disconnecting and attaching DB nodes.
Also please note that you cannot do major version up in the method described below
(i.e. the version up should not require dump/restore).
</p>

<p>
<ol>
    <li><p>
    Prepare online recovery.</p>
    </li>

    <li><p>Version up should perform nodes which are not master node first.
        Stop PostgreSQL on a non-master node.
        Pgpool-II will detect PostgreSQL termination and degenerate emitting logs below.
        At this point all sessions connected to pgpool-II disconnected.
        </p>
<pre>
2010-07-27 16:32:29 LOG:   pid 10215: set 1 th backend down status
2010-07-27 16:32:29 LOG:   pid 10215: starting degeneration. shutdown host localhost(5433)
2010-07-27 16:32:29 LOG:   pid 10215: failover_handler: set new master node: 0
2010-07-27 16:32:29 LOG:   pid 10215: failover done. shutdown host localhost(5433)
</pre>
    </li>

    <li><p>
    Version up PostgreSQL on the stopping node.
    You can overwrite old PostgreSQL, we recommend move old PostgreSQL somewhere
    so that you could recover it just in case however.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li><p>
    If you install new PostgreSQL in different location from the old one and
    do not want to update your recovery script,
    you need to match the path by using tools including symbolic link.
    If you choose to overwrite, you can skip following steps till installation of C function step.
    You can execute online recovery immediately.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li><p>
    Change installation directory of old PostgreSQL.
    Installting directory of PostgreSQL is supposed to be /usr/local/pgsql in following description.
    </p>
<pre>
$ mv /usr/local/pgsql /usr/local/pgsql-old
</pre>
    </li>

    <li><p>
    Create a symbolic link to the location where newer version of PostgreSQL installed.
    This allow you to continue to use command search path you currently use.
    Installing directory of newer PostgreSQL is supposed to be /usr/local/pgsql-new in following description.
    </p>
<pre>
$ ln -s /usr/local/pgsql-new /usr/local/pgsql
</pre>
    </li>

    <li><p>
    If database directory is located under older PostgreSQL installation directory,
    you should create or copy so that newer PostgreSQL can access it.
    We use symbolic link in the following example.
    </p>
<pre>
$ ln -s /usr/local/pgsql-old/data /usr/local/pgsql/data
</pre>
    </li>

    <li><p>
    Install C functions into PostgreSQL. "Installing C functions" section may help you.
    Because online recovery copies database cluster, the last step installing functions
    using psql is not necessary.
    Do make install.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li><p>
    Do online recovery. You are done with one node version up.
    To execute online recovery, you can use <a href="#pcp_recovery_node">pcp_recovery_node</a> or pgpoolAdmin.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li><p>
    Repeat steps above on each node. In the very last master node should be updated.
    You are done.
    </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>If you are using streaming replication</h3>
<p>
You can update standby PostgreSQL server without stopping pgpool-II.
</p>

<p>
The procedure to update standby PostgreSQL servers are same as the one of replication mode.
Please refer to "Online recovery with Streaming Replication" to set up recovery_1st_stage_command and recovery_2nd_stage_command.
</p>

<p>
You cannot version up primary server without stopping pgpool-II.
You need to stop pgpool-II while updating primary server.
The procedure to update primary PostgreSQL server is same as the one standby server.
The procedure to update primary PostgreSQL server is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Stop pgpool-II</li>
    <li>Stop primary PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>Update primary PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>Start primary PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>Start pgpool-II</li>
</ol>

<p class="top_link"><a href="#Top">back to top</a></p>

<!-- ================================================================================ -->

<h1><a name="backup"></a>Backup</h1>
<p>
To back up backend PostgreSQL servers and system DB, you can use physical
backup, logical backup (pg_dump, pg_dumpall) and PITR in the same manner as PostgreSQL.
Please note that using logical backup and PITR should be performed directory with PostgreSQL,
rather than via pgpool-II to avoid errors caused by <a href="#LOAD_BALANCE_MODE">load_balance_mode</a> and
<a href="#REPLICATE_SELECT">replicate_select</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="backup_rep_or_ms_mode">replication mode and master/slave mode</h2>
<p>
If pgpool-II is operated in replication mode or master/slave mode, take a backup on one DB nodes in the cluster.
</p>

<p>
If you are using master/slave mode and asynchronous replication
systems(Slony-I and streaming replication) and need the latest backup,
you should take a backup on the master node.
</p>

<p>
pg_dump takes ACCESS SHARE lock on database. Commands taking ACCESS
EXECUTE lock, such as ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, REINDEX,
CLUSTER and VACUUM FULL will wait for the completion of pg_dump because
of lock conflict. Also this may affect the primary node even if you are
doing pg_dump on standby.
</p>

<h2 id="backup_parallel">Parallel mode</h2>
<p>
If you are using parallel mode and need to take a consistent backup, you need to stop pgpool-II.
</p>

<p>
To use logical backup, stop applications and pgpool-II then perform pg_dump or pg_dumpall on all nodes.
After finishing backup, start pgpool-II then start applications.
</p>

<p>
To use PITR, please make sure that system times are identical on all nodes.
Prepare archive logging and take base backup.
After finishing backup, stop and restart applications or pgpool-II.
Record the time of stop and start.
This temporary stop will make consistent state among all over cluster.
If you need to restore form the base backup and archive log,
set recovery_target_time of recovery.conf in the middle of the start/stop time.
</p>

<h2 id="backup_system_db">Backing up of system DB</h2>
<p>
You need to backup system DB if pgpool-II is operated in parallel query
mode or if you are using query cache.
Backup database specified by system_db_dbname in pgpool.conf.
</p>

<h1><a name="deploy"></a>Deploying pgpool-II</a></h1>
<p>
pgpool-II can run on a dedicated server, on the server where application
server is running on or other servers.  In this section we discuss how
to make those deployments and pros and cons.
</p>

<p>
<dl>
<dt>Dedicated server</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    Pgpool-II is running on a dedicated server.
    It's simple and pgpool-II is not affected by other server softwares.
    Obvious cons is you need to buy more hardware.
    Also pgpool-II can be a single point of failure with this configuration
    (you can avoid this by enabling <a href="#watchdog">watchdog</a> or using pgpool-HA described described below).
    </p>
    </dd>

<dt>Deploying on a web server or application server</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    Deploying pgpool-II on a server where Apache, JBoss, Tomcat or other web
    server and application servers.
    Since communication between pgpool-II and web servers and application servers
    is within a local machine, socket communication can be faster than inter-sever communication.
    Also if you are using multiple web serves or application servers, you can avoid
    the single point of failure problem
    (in this case you must have identical pgpool.conf on each pgpool-II instance except the <a href="#watchdog">watchdog section</a>).
		</p>
		<p>
		We strongly recommend to enable <a href="#watchdog">watchdog</a> to avoid following concerns in this configuration.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the communication between pgpool-II and DB servers is not stable, it is possible
            that DB node #1 is down from a point of a pgpool-II instance,
            while it is up from other pgpool-II instance's point of view.
            To avoid this, you can multiplex the network connection.
        </li>
        <li>While executing online recovery in replication mode,
            you need to stop all pgpool-II instances except the one which is doing online recovery.
            Otherwise DB can be running into inconsistent state.
            In master slave mode+streaming replication mode, you do not need to stop other pgpool-II instances.
            You should not execute online recovery at the same time on multiple pgpool-II instances however.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </dd>

<dt>Running pgpool-II on DB server</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    Running pgpool-II on the server as PostgreSQL is running on.
    You can avoid the single point of failure problem of pgpool-II with configuration.
    And obviously you do need to buy additional dedicated server.
    Problem with this configuration is, application need to aware of which DB server they should connect to.
    To solve the problem you can use virtual IP with <a href="#watchdog">watchdog</a> or pgpool-HA.
    </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="pgpool_ha">About pgpool-HA</h2>
<p>
Pgpool-HA is a high availability software for pgpool-II using heartbeat.
Pgpool-HA is a sub-project of the pgpool project as well as pgpool-II.
Pgpool-HA can be available from the pgpool development site as an open source software.

<h1 id="watchdog">Watchdog <span class="version">V3.2 -</span></h1>
<h2 id="what_is_watchdog">What is watchdog</h2>

<p>
"Watchdog" is a sub process of pgpool-II to add high availability.
This resolve the single point of failure by coordinating multiple pgpool-IIs.
watchdog adds the following features to pgpool-II.
</p>
<h3>Life checking of pgpool-II</h3>
    <p>
    Watchdog monitors pgpool-IIs by either of two methods, "heartbeat" mode or "query" mode.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    In heartbeat mode, watchdog monitors other pgpool-II processes by using heartbeat signal.
    Watchdog receives heartbeat signals sent by other pgpool-II periodically.
    If there are no signal for a certain period, watchdog regards this as failure of the pgpool-II.
    For redundancy you can use multiple network connections for heartbeat exchange between pgpool-IIs.
    This is the default mode and recommended.
    </li>
    <li>
    In query mode, watchdog monitors pgpool-II's service rather than process.
    watchdog sends queries to other pgpool-II and checks the response.
    Note that this method requires connections from other pgpool-IIs, so it would fail motoring if
    <a href="#NUM_INIT_CHILDREN">num_init_children </a>isn't large enough.
    This mode is deprecated and left for backward compatibility.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Also watchdog monitors connections to upstream servers
    (application servers etc.) from the pgpool-II, and checks whether the pgpool-II can serves to the servers.
    If the monitoring fails, watchdog treats the pgpool-II as down.
    </p>

<h3>Coordinating multiple pgpool-IIs</h3>
    <p>
    Watchdog coordinates multiple pgpool-IIs by exchanging information with each other.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    When backend node status changes by failover etc., watchdog notifies the information to other pgpool-IIs and synchronizes them.
    When online recovery occurs, watchdog restricts client connections to other pgpool-IIs for avoiding inconsistency between backends.
    </li>
    <li>
    Commands on failback or failover (<a href="#FAILOVER_COMMAND">failover_command</a>,
    <a href="#FAILBACK_COMMAND">failback_command</a>, <a href="#FOLLOW_MASTER_COMMAND">follow_master_command</a>)
    are executed by only one pgpool-II by interlocking.
    </li>
    </ul>

<h3>Changing active/standby state in case of certain faults detected</h3>
    <p>
    When a fault of pgpool-II is detected, watchdog notifies the other watchdogs of it.
    If this is the active pgpool-II, watchdogs decides the new active pgpool-II by voting and change active/standby state.
    </p>

<h3>Automatic virtual IP address assigning synchronous to server switching</h3>
    <p>
    When a standby pgpool-II server promotes to active, the new active server brings up virtual IP interface.
    Meanwhile, the previous active server brings down the virtual IP interface.
    This enables the active pgpool-II to work using the same IP address even when servers are switched.
    </p>

<h3>Automatic registration of a server as standby in recovery</h3>
    <p>
    When broken server recovers or new server is attached,
    the watchdog process notifies the other watchdog process along with information of the new server,
    and the watchdog process receives information on the active server and other servers.
    Then, the attached server is registered as a standby.
    </p>
</dl>

<h2 id="watchdog_server_composition">Server composition</h2>

<p>
Figure below describes how pgpool-II and watchdog process is configured.
</p>
<p><img src="wd-en.jpg" alt="watchdog server composition" hight=70% width=70%></p>

<h2 id="start_watchdog">Starting/stopping watchdog</h2>
<p>
Watchdog process starts/stops automatically as sub-processes of pgpool-II,
therefore there is no dedicated command to start/stop it.
</p>
<p>
Watchdog requires <font color="red">root privilege</font> for controling the virtual IP interface.
One method is to start pgpool-II by root privilege.
However, for security reason, to set custom commands to <a href="#IF_UP_CMD">if_up_cmd</a>,
<a href="#IF_DOWN_CMD">if_up_cmd</a>, <a href="#ARPING_CMD">if_up_cmd</a> using sudo or setuid is recommended method.
</p>
<p>
Watchdog's life-checking starts after after all of the pgpool-IIs has started.
This doesn't start if not all "other" nodes are alive
Until this, failover of the virtual IP never occurs.
</p>

<h2>Configuring watchdog (pgpool.conf)</h2>
<p>
Watchdog configuration parameters are described in pgpool.conf.
There is sample configuration in WATCHDOG section in pgpool.conf.sample file.
</p>

<p>
All following options are required to be specified in watchdog process.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="USE_WATCHDOG"></a>use_watchdog <span class="version">V3.2 -</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    If on, activates watchdog. Default is off.
    </p>
    <p>
    You need to restart pgpool-II if you change this value.
    </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

    This option specifies the authentication key used in watchdog communication.
    All the pgpool-II must have the same key.
    Packets from watchdog of wrong key will be rejects.
    This authentication is applied also for heatrbeat singals if lifecheck method is heartbeat mode.
    If this is empty (default), watchdog doesn't conduct authenticate.
    </p>
    <p>
    You need to restart pgpool-II if you change this value.
    </p>

    Therefore, it is recommended to specify multiple servers.
    </p>
    <p>
    If this option is empty, watchdog doesn't check up stream connections.

<h3>Behaivor on escalation</h3>

<p> Configuration about behavior when pgpool-II escalates to active (virtual IP holder)

<dl>
<dt><a name="CLEAR_MEMQCACHE_ON_ESCALATION"></a>clear_memqcache_on_escalation <span class="version">V3.3 -</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    If this is on, watchdog clears all the query cache in the shared memory when pgpool-II escaltes to active.
    This prevents the new active pgpool-II from using old query caches inconsistence to the old active.
    Default is on.
    </p>
    <p>
    This works only if <a href="#MEMQCACHE_METHOD">memqcache_method</a> is 'shmem'.
    </p>
    </dd>

<dt><a name="WD_ESCALATION_COMMAND"></a>wd_escalation_command <span class="version">V3.3 -</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    Watchdog executes this command on the new active when pgpool-II escaltes to active.
    The timing is just before virtual IP brings up.
    </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Life checking pgpool-II</h3>

<p>Watchdog checks pgpool-II status periodically. This is called "life check".

<h4>Common</h4>

<dl>
<dt><a name="WD_LIFECHECK_METHOD"></a>wd_lifecheck_method <span class="version">V3.3 -</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    This parameter specifies the method of life check. This is either of 'heartbeat' (default) or 'query'.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 'heartbeat' mode, watchdog sends heartbeat singals (UDP packets) periodically to other pgpool-II.
    Watchdog also receives the signals from other pgpool-II.
    If there are no signal for a certain period, watchdog regards is as failure of the pgpool-II.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 'query' mode, watchdog sends monitoring queries to other pgpool-II and checks the response.
    </p>
    <p>
    <font color="red">CAUTION: In query mode, you need to set <a href="#NUM_INIT_CHILDREN">num_init_children</a>
    large enough if you plan to use watchdog. This is because the watchdog process connects to pgpool-II as a client.</font>
    </p>
    <p>

    <dd>
    <p>
    This option specifies the destination of heartbeat signals by IP address or hostname.
    You can use multiple destination.
    The number at the end of the parameter name is referred as "destination number",
    and it starts from 0.
    This works only heartbeat mode.
    </p>
    <p>
    You need to restart pgpool-II if you change this value.
    </p>
    </dd>

<dt><a name="HEARTBEAT_DESTINATION_PORT"></a>heartbeat_destination_port<font color="red">0</font> <span class="version">V3.3 -</span></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    This option specifies the port number of destination of heartbeat signals
    which is specified by <a href="HEARTBEAT_DESTINATION">heartbeat_destinationX</a>.
    This is usually the same value as <a href="WD_HEARTBEAT_PORT">wd_heartbeat_port</a>
    You must use another value if the port number is unusable on a certain host or
    there are more than two pgpool-IIs in a host.
    The number at the end of the parameter name is referred as "destination number",
    and it starts from 0.
    This works only heartbeat mode.

    The number at the end of the parameter name is referred as "destination number",
    and it starts from 0.
    This works only heartbeat mode. This is ignored when the value is empty.
    In addition, this works only when pgpool-II has root privilege and are running on Linux,
    because this uses SO_BINDTODEVICE socket option.

<h2 id="watchdog_restrictions">Restrictions on watchdog</h2>
<ul>
<li>
In query mode, when all the DB nodes are detached from a pgpool-II due to PostgreSQL server failure or
pcp_detach_node issued, watchdog regards that the pgpool-II service is in down status and
brings the virtual IP assigned to watchdog down. Thus clients of pgpool cannot connect to
pgpool-II using the virtual IP any more. This is neccessary to avoid <i>split-brain</i>,
that is, situations where there are multiple active pgpool-II.
</li>
<li>
Don't connect to pgpool-II in down status using the real IP. Because a pgpool-II in down status
can't receive information from watchdog, its backend status may be different from other pgpool-II.
</li>
<li>
pgpool-II in down status can't become active nor standby pgpool-II.
Recovery from down status requires restart of pgpool-II.
</li>
<li>
Please note that after the active pgpool-II stops, it will take a few seconds until the
standby pgpool-II promote to new active, to make sure that the former virtual IP is brought
down before a down notification packet is sent to other pgpool-IIs.

<h2 id="pcp_comand_args">Common Command-line Arguments</h2>

<p>There are five arguments common to all of the PCP commands. They
give information about pgpool-II and authentication. Extra
arguments may be needed for some commands.

<pre>
e.g.)  $ pcp_node_count 10 localhost 9898 postgres hogehoge
</pre>

<table border>
<tr>
<th>First argument</th>
<td>timeout value in seconds. PCP disconnects if pgpool-II does not respond in this many seconds.</td>

<tr><th>Third argument</th><td>PCP port number</td></tr>
<tr><th>Fourth argument</th><td>PCP user name</td></tr>
<tr><th>Fifth argument</th><td>PCP password</td></tr>
</table>

<p>PCP user names and passwords must be declared in
<code>pcp.conf</code> in <code>$prefix/etc</code>
directory. <code>-F</code> option can be used when starting pgpool-II
if <code>pcp.conf</code> is placed somewhere else. The password does
not need to be in md5 format when passing it to the PCP commands.</p>

<dt id="health_check_failed">Health check failed</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    Pgpool-II's health checking feature detects DB nodes failure.

</pre>

    <p>
    The log shows that the DB node 1 (host foo) goes down and disconnected (shutdown)
    from pgpool, and then that DB node 0 becomes new master.
    Check DB node 1 and remove the cause of failure. After that perform an online
    recovery against DB node 1 if possible.
    </p>
    </dd>

<dt id="failed_to_read_kind_from_frontend">Failed to read kind from frontend</dt>
    <dd>
<pre>
2010-07-26 18:43:24 LOG:   pid 24161: ProcessFrontendResponse: failed to read kind from frontend. frontend abnormally exited
</pre>
    <p>
    This log indicates that the frontend program didn't disconnect properly from
    pgpool-II.
    The possible causes are: bugs of client applications, forced termination (kill)
    of a client application, or temporary network failure.
    This kind of events don't lead to a DB destruction or data consistency problem.
    It's only a warning about a protocol violation.
    It is advised that you check the applications and networks if the
    message keeps on occurring.
    </p>
    </dd>

<dt id="kind_mismatch">Kind mismatch errors</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    It is possible that you get this error when pgpool-II operates in replication mode.
    </p>
<pre>
2010-07-22 14:18:32 ERROR: pid 9966: kind mismatch among backends. Possible last query was: "FETCH ALL FROM c;" kind details are: 0[T] 1[E: cursor "c" does not exist]
</pre>
    <p>
    Pgpool-II waits for responses from the DB nodes after sending an SQL command  to them.
    This message indicates that not all DB nodes returned the same kind of response.
    You'll get the SQL statement which possibly caused the error after "Possible last query was:".
    Then the kind of response follows. If the response indicates an error, the
    error message from PostgreSQL is shown.
    Here you see "0[T]" displaying the DB node responses: "0[T]"
    (starting to send row description), and "1[E" indicates that DB node 1 returns an error
    with message "cursor "c" does not exist", while DB node 0 sends a row description.
    </p>
    <p>
    Caution: You will see this error when operating in master/slave mode as well.
    For example, even in the master/slave mode, SET command will be basically sent to all DB nodes
    to keep all the DB nodes in the same state.
    </p>
    <p>
    Check the databases and re-sync them using online recovery if you find
    that they are out of sync.

<dt id="difference_of_number">Pgpool detected difference of the number of inserted, updated or deleted tuples

</pre>
    <p>
    In the example above, the returned number of updated rows by "update t1 set i = 1"
    was different among DB nodes.
    The next line indicates that DB 1 got degenerated (disconnected) as a consequence,
    and that the number of affected rows for DB node 0 was 0,
    while for DB node 1 that was 1.
    </p>
    <p>
    Stop the DB node which is suspected of having wrong data and do an online recovery.

<h1>Restrictions<a name="restriction"></a></h1>

<p>
<h2>Functionality of PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you use pg_terminate_backend() to stop a backend, this will trigger
     a failover.
     The reason why this happens is that PostgreSQL sends exactly the same
     message for a terminated backend as for a full postmaster shutdown.
     There is no workaround as of today. Please do not use this function.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h2><a name="md5"></a>Authentication / Access Controls</h2>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>In the replication mode or master/slave mode, trust, clear text password,
        and pam methods are supported. md5 in also supported since pgpool-II 3.0.
        md5 is supported by using a authencitaion file ("pool_passwd").
        "pool_passwd" is default name of the authentication file.
        You can change the file name using <a href="#POOL_PASSWD">pool_passwd</a>.
        Here are the steps to enable md5 authentication:
        <ol>
            <li>Login as the database's operating system user and type
                "pg_md5 --md5auth --username=<your_username> <your_passwd>"
                 user name and md5 encrypted password are registered into pool_passwd.
                 If pool_passwd does not exist yet, pg_md5 command will
                 automatically create it for you.</li>
            <li>The format of pool_passwd is "username:encrypted_passwd".</li>
            <li>You also need to add an appropriate md5 entry to pool_hba.conf.
                See <a href="#hba">Setting up pool_hba.conf for client authentication (HBA)</a>
                for more details.</li>
            <li>Please note that the user name and password must be
                 identical to those registered in PostgreSQL.</li>
            <li>After changing md5 password(in both pool_passwd and PostgreSQL of course),
                you need to execute "pgpool reload" or restart pgpool(if your pgpool is 3.1 or before).</li>
       </ol>
    </li>
    <li>In all the other modes, trust, clear text password, crypt, md5,
        and pam methods are supported.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Large objects</h2>
<p>
pgpool-II 2.3.2 or later supports large object replication if the backend is
PostgreSQL 8.1 or later.
For this, you need to
enable <a href="#lobj_lock_table">lobj_lock_table</a> directive in pgpool.conf.
Large object replication using backend function lo_import is not supported, however.
</p>

<h2 id="temp_table_in_master_slave_mode">Temporary tables in master/slave mode</h2>
<p>
Creating/inserting/updating/deleting temporary tables are always executed on the
master(primary).
With pgpool-II 3.0 or later, SELECT on these tables is executed on master as well.
However if the temporary table name is used as a literal in SELECT, there's no
way to detect it, and the SELECT will be load balanced.
That will trigger a "not found the table" error or will find another table
having same name.
To avoid the problem, use /*NO LOAD BALANCE*/ SQL comment.
</p>

<pre>
Sample SELECT which causes a problem:
SELECT 't1'::regclass::oid;
</pre>

<p>
psql's \d command uses literal table names.
pgpool-II 3.0 or later checks if the SELECT includes any access to system
catalogs and always send these queries to the master.
Thus we avoid the problem.
</p>

<h2 id="caution_in_replication_mode">Functions, etc. In Replication Mode</h2>

<p>There is no guarantee that any data provided using a context-dependent
mechanism (e.g. random number, transaction ID, OID, SERIAL, sequence), will be
replicated correctly on multiple backends.</p>
<p>For SERIAL, enabling insert_lock will help replicating data.
insert_lock also helps SELECT setval() and SELECT nextval().</p>

<p>In pgpool-II 2.3 or later, INSERT/UPDATE using CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
CURRENT_DATE, now() will be replicated correctly. INSERT/UPDATE for tables
using CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE, now() as their DEFAULT values will also
be replicated correctly.
This is done by replacing those functions by constants fetched from master at
query execution time.
There are a few limitations however:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>In pgpool-II 3.0 or before, the calculation of temporal data in table default value is not accurate
        in some cases. For example, the following table definition:
<pre>
CREATE TABLE rel1(
  d1 date DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE + 1
)
</pre>
    is treated the same as:
<pre>
CREATE TABLE rel1(
  d1 date DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
)
</pre>
    <p>
    pgpool-II 3.1 or later handles these cases correctly.
    Thus the column "d1" will have tomorrow as the default value.
    However this enhancement does not apply if extended protocols(used in JDBC,
    PHP PDO for example) or PREPARE are used.
    </p>
    <p>
    Please note that if the column type is not a temporal one, rewriting is
    not performed. Such example:
    </p>
<pre>
foo bigint default (date_part('epoch'::text,('now'::text)::timestamp(3) with time zone) * (1000)::double precision)
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Suppose we have the following table:
<pre>
CREATE TABLE rel1(
  c1 int,
  c2 timestamp default now()
)
</pre>

    We can replicate
<pre>
INSERT INTO rel1(c1) VALUES(1)
</pre>

    since this turn into
<pre>
INSERT INTO rel1(c1, c2) VALUES(1, '2009-01-01 23:59:59.123456+09')
</pre>

    However,
<pre>
INSERT INTO rel1(c1) SELECT 1
</pre>
    cannot to be transformed, thus cannot be properly replicated in the current implementation.
    Values will still be inserted, with no transformation at all.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Tables created by <code>CREATE TEMP TABLE</code> will be deleted at the end of
the session by specifying DISCARD ALL in reset_query_list if you are using
PostgreSQL 8.3 or later.
</p>
<p>
For 8.2.x or earlier, <code>CREATE TEMP TABLE</code> will not be
deleted after exiting a session. It is because of the connection
pooling which, from PostgreSQL's backend point of view, keeps the
session alive. To avoid this, you must explicitly drop the
temporary tables by issuing <code>DROP TABLE</code>, or use <code>CREATE TEMP
TABLE ... ON COMMIT DROP</code> inside the transaction block.</p>

<h2 id="ng_queries">Queries</h2>

<p>Here are the queries which cannot be processed by pgpool-II</p>

<h3 id="ng_prepare">PREPARE (for parallel mode)</h3>
<p>
Prepared statements created by <code>PREPARE</code> are not supported.
</p>

<h3 id="ng_insert">INSERT (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p>You cannot use <code>DEFAULT</code> for the
partitioning key column. For example, if a column x in a table t
is the partitioning key column,
</p>

<pre>
INSERT INTO t(x) VALUES (DEFAULT);
</pre>
<p>
isn't supported. Also, you cannot use functions for the value as below.
</p>

<pre>
INSERT INTO t(x) VALUES (func());
</pre>
<p>
You must use explicit constant values for the partitioning key column.
</p>
<p>
In addition, none of <code>SELECT INTO</code>, <code>INSERT INTO ... SELECT</code>,
and multiple rows <code>INSERT</code> using <code>VALUES</code> as follows are supported.
</p>
<pre>
INSERT INTO t(x) VALUES (1),(2),(3);
</pre>

<h3 id="ng_update">UPDATE (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p>Data consistency between the backends may be lost if the
partitioning key column values are updated. pgpool-II does not
re-partition the updated data.</p>

<p>A transaction cannot be rolled back if a query has caused an error
on some backends due to a constraint violation.</p>

<p>If a function is called in the <code>WHERE</code> clause, that
query might not be executed correctly, for example:
<pre>
UPDATE branches set bid = 100 where bid = (select max(bid) from beances);
</pre>
</p>

<h3 id="ng_select_for_update">SELECT ... FOR UPDATE (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p>If a function is called in the <code>WHERE</code> clause, that
query might not be executed correctly. For example:
<pre>
SELECT * FROM  branches where bid = (select max(bid) from beances) FOR UPDATE;
</pre>
</p>

<h3 id="ng_copy">COPY (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p><code>COPY BINARY</code> is not supported. Copying from files is
also not supported. Only <code>COPY FROM STDIN</code> and <code>COPY
TO STDOUT</code> are supported.</p>

<h3 id="ng_create_table">ALTER/CREATE TABLE (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p>To update the partitioning rule, pgpool-II must be restarted in
order to read them from the System DB.</p>

<h3 id="ng_transaction">Transaction (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p><code>SELECT</code> statements executed inside a transaction block
will be executed in a separate transaction. Here is an example:

<pre>
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO t(a) VALUES (1);
SELECT * FROM t ORDER BY a; &lt;-- INSERT above is not visible from this SELECT statement
END;
</pre>

<h3 id="ng_view">Views / Rules (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p>
The same definition will be created on all the backends for views and rules.
</p>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM a, b where a.i = b.i
</pre>
<p>
<code>JOIN</code>s like above will be executed on each backend, and
then merged with the results returned by each backend. Views and Rules
that join across the nodes cannot be created.
However, to JOIN tables that access data only in the same node, a VIEW can be made.
This VIEW has to be registered in the pgpool_catalog.dist_def table. A col_name and
a dist_def_func will have to be registered too. These are used when an insert is
performed on the view.
</p>

<h3 id="ng_fuction">Functions / Triggers (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p>The same definition will be created on all the backends for
functions. Joining across the nodes, and accessing data on the other nodes cannot
be performed inside the functions.</p>

<h3>Extended Query Protocol (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p>The extended query protocol used by JDBC drivers, etc. is not
supported. The simple query protocol must be used. This means you cannot use
prepared statements.</p>

<h3 id="ng_natural_join">Natural Join (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p>The Natural Join is not supported.
"ON join condition" or "USING (join_column)" must be used.</p>

<h3 id="ng_extended_protocol">USING CLAUSE (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p>The USING CLAUSE is converted to an ON CLAUSE by the query rewrite process.
Therefore, when "*" is used at target list, the joined column(s) appear twice.</p>
<p>
Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
=# SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 USING(id);
 id |  t  |   t
----+-----+-------
  1 | 1st | first
(1 row)
</pre>
<p>
In the rewrite process "USING" is translated into "ON". So the
effective result is as follows:
</p>
<pre>
=# SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
 id |  t  | id |   t
----+-----+----+-------
  1 | 1st |  1 | first
(1 row)
</pre>

<p>
Notice that column "t" is duplicated.
</p>

<h3 id="ng_multibyte_chars">Multi-byte Characters (for all modes)</h3>

<p>pgpool-II does not translate between different multi-byte
characters. The encoding for the client, backend and System DB must be
the same.</p>

<h3 id="ng_multi_statement">Multi-statement Query (for all modes)</h3>
<p>
pgpool-II cannot process multi-statement queries.
</p>

<h3 id="ng_dead_lock">Deadlocks (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p>Deadlocks across the backends cannot be detected. For example:
</p>
<pre>
(tellers table is partitioned using the following rule)
  tid &lt;= 10  --&gt; node 0
  tid &gt;= 10  --&gt; node 1

A) BEGIN;
B) BEGIN;
A) SELECT * FROM tellers WHERE tid = 11 FOR UPDATE;
B) SELECT * FROM tellers WHERE tid = 1 FOR UPDATE;
A) SELECT * FROM tellers WHERE tid = 1 FOR UPDATE;
B) SELECT * FROM tellers WHERE tid = 11 FOR UPDATE;
</pre>
<p>
In the case above, a single node cannot detect the deadlock, so
pgpool-II will wait for the response indefinitely. This phenomenon
can occur with any query that acquires row level locks.
</p>
<p>Also, if a deadlock occurs in one node, transaction states in each
node will not be consistent. Therefore, pgpool-II terminates the
process if a deadlock is detected.
</p>
<pre>
pool_read_kind: kind does not match between master(84) slot[1] (69)
</pre>

<h3 id="ng_schema">Schemas (for parallel mode)</h3>

<p>Objects in a schema other than public must be fully qualified like:
</p>
<pre>
schema.object
</pre>
<p>
pgpool-II cannot resolve the correct schema when the path is set as
follows:
</p>
<pre>
set search_path = xxx
</pre>
<p>
and the schema name is omitted in a query.
</p>

<h3 id="ng_relname">table name - column name(for parallel mode)</h3>
<p>
Limitation object:Parallel mode
</p>
<p>
A table or a column name cannot start by pool_.
When rewriting queries, these names are used by internal processing.
</p>

<h2 id="caution_system_db">System DB</h2>

<h3>Partitioning Rules</h3>

<p>Only one partitioning key column can be defined in one
partitioning rule. Conditions like 'x or y' are not supported.</p>

<h2>Environment Requirements</h2>

<h3>libpq</h3>

<p><code>libpq</code> is linked while building pgpool-II. libpq
version must be 3.0. Building pgpool-II with libpq version 2.0 will
fail. Also, the System DB must be PostgreSQL 7.4 or later.</p>

<h2 id="caution_query_cache">Query Cache</h2>

<p>With <a href="#query_cache">on disk query cache, invalidation must be done manually.
This does not apply to <a href="#memqcache">in memory query cache</a>.

<!-- ================================================================================ -->

<h1>Internal information<a name="internal"></a></h1>
<p>
pgpool-II version 2.0.x brings extensive modifications, compared with the version 1.x
Please note that what follows doesn't apply to version 1.x.
</p>

<h2 id="parallel_execute_engine">Parallel execution engine</h2>
<p>
The parallel execution engine is built into pgpool-II.
This engine performs the same Query on each node, and drives the engine that
transmits the result to the front end, depending on the nodes' answers.
</p>

<h2 id="rewrite_query">Query Rewriting</h2>
<p>
This explains the Query rewriting that pgpool-II does in parallel mode.
</p>
<p>
In parallel mode, a query transmitted by the client goes through two stages of
processing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis of Query
<li>Rewriting of Query
</ul>
<p>
What follows explains these two processing steps:
</p>

<h3 id="analyze_query">Analysis of Query</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
The retrieval query submitted by the client goes through the SQL parser.
It is then analyzed using information stored in the system DB. Execution status of each part
of this query is updated using this information.
</p>
<p>
This execution status stores where this node can be treated.
For instance, if a table's data is distributed on several nodes
(as declared in the catalog's pgpool_catalog.dist_def table),
it has to be retrieved from all nodes. On the other hand, data from a table
registered in pgpool_catalog.replicate_def is replicated, and can therefore
be retrieved from any node.
</p>
<p>
These states are 'P' when data has to be processed by all nodes,
'L' when it should be processed by one node.
The 'S' status is a special case: it means that there is another step to be performed
on the data after retrieving it from all nodes. For example, sorting data coming from a table
registered in the pgpool_catalog.dist_def table.
</p>

<p>
The retrieval query is analyzed in the following order, and its execution status
changes during this processing. Where the query will be processed depends on the
final status of the main select.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Are UNION, EXTRACT, and INTERSECT used or not?</li>
  <li>What is the Execution status of FROM clause ?</li>
  <li>Change the execution status by TARGETLIST</li>
  <li>Change in execution status according to WHERE clause</li>
  <li>Change in execution status according to GROUP BY clause</li>
  <li>Change in execution status according to HAVING clause</li>
  <li>Change in execution status according to ORDER BY clause</li>
  <li>Changes into the LIMIT OFFSET predicate in the execution status.</li>
  <li>Acquisition of the final execution status of SELECT</li>
</ol>

<p>
The relation between the final execution status of SELECT and the processing
place is as follows.
</p>

<p>
<table border>
<tr class="header"><th>Execution status</th><th>Processed place</th></tr>
<tr><th>L</th><td>Query issued on either node. </td></tr>
<tr><th>P</th><td>Returns data to the client by running the
same query on all nodes and using the parallel execution engine.</td></tr>
<tr><th>S</th><td>After processing using the system DB, data
is returned to the client. </td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
The above-mentioned rule also applies to Sub-Query. In the simple following
Query, if p1-table is registered in pgpool_catalog.dist_def table of the system
DB (p1-table is distributed), the final execution status of the subquery
becomes P, and as a result, the parent of the subquery, SELECT, also becomes P.
</p>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM P1-table) as P2-table;
</pre>

<p>
Next, let's explain how the execution status changes concretely.
Let's start with an example, to explain the FROM status.
</p>

<h4>Execution status of FROM clause</h4>
<p>
This is a retrieval Query (SELECT). The data set and its status (P,L and S) is
defined according to the FROM clause

The execution status of the table is as follows: when there is only one table in
the from clause, the execution status of the entire dataset is this table's
execution status. When there are two or more tables or sub-queries in the FROM
clause, the execution is decided according to the join method and the execution
statuses, as show in the following table.
</p>

<p>
<table border>
<tr class="header"><th>JOIN type</th>
<th colspan="3"> LEFT OUTER JOIN </th>
<th colspan="3"> RIGHT OUTER JOIN </th>
<th colspan="3">FULL OUTER JOIN</th>
<th colspan="3">Other</th></tr>
<tr class="center"><th>left/right</th><td> P </td><td> L </td><td> S </td><td> P </td><td> L </td><td> S </td><td> P </td><td> L </td><td> S </td><td> P </td><td> L </td><td> S </td></tr>

<tr class="center"><th> P </th><td> S </td><td> P </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> P </td><td> S </td></tr>

<tr class="center"><th> L </th><td> S </td><td> L </td><td> S </td><td> P </td><td> L </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> L </td><td> S </td><td> P </td><td> L </td><td> S </td></tr>

<tr class="center"><th> S </th><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td><td> S </td></tr>

</table>
</p>

<p>
In the following examples, P1-table is in the P status.
L1-table and L2-table are in the  L status.
</p>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM P1-table,L1-table,L2-table;
</pre>

<p>
P1-table (left) and L1-table (right) are joined, and according to the table they
get the P status. With this P status, they are joined with the L2-table, in the L
status, which is now in the P status too.
</p>


<h4>Changes in execution status because of TARGETLIST and WHERE clause</h4>
<p>
In a basic Query, the execution status is the one from the FROM clause.
However, if there is a TARGETLIST, the execution status of the WHERE clause can
change in the following cases.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>When there is a subquery</li>
    <li>When there is an aggregate function or DISTINCT in TARGETLIST marked as 'P'</li>
    <li>When a column that does not exist in a table (data set)
        in the FROM clause is used</li>
</ol>
<p>
In these cases, the final execution status of the subquery, the execution status of TARGETLIST
and the WHERE clause get the S status if the initial status was P or S.
</p>
<p>
In the following example, when the table used by the subquery is P,
the final execution status of the subquery gets the P status.
Therefore, The execution status of the WHERE clause gets the S status,
whatever the execution status of L1 is, and this query is run in the system DB.
</p>
<pre>
SELECT * FROM L1-table where L1-table.column IN (SELECT * FROM P1-table);
</pre>
<p>
The FROM clause changes to the S status when there is an aggregate function in
a 'P' TARGETLIST, in order to perform the aggregate after all data has been
acquired.
Some optimization on the aggregate function is done under specific conditions.
</p>
<p>
A column that does not exist in a table can be used in a query. For instance, in
the following correlated subquery:
</p>
<pre>
SELECT * FROM L1-table WHERE L1-table.col1 IN (SELECT * FROM P1-table WHERE P1-table.col = L1-table.col1);
</pre>
<p>
This subquery refers to L1-table.col1, from the L1-table. The execution status
of the WHERE clause of the subquery is 'S'.
</p>

<h4>Change in execution status because of GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY and LIMIT/OFFSET</h4>

<p>
The execution status of the WHERE clause is changed to 'S' when there is any GROUP
BY, HAVING, or ORDER BY clause, or LIMIT/OFFSET predicate and status is 'P'. A
query with no GROUP BY clause gets the execution status of the WHERE clause.
In the same way, the execution status of the GROUP BY clause is
used when there is no HAVING clause. The ORDER BY clause and the LIMIT/OFFSET
predicate are also similar in this behavior.
</p>

<h4>When UNION, EXTRACT, and INTERSECT are used</h4>
<p>
UNION, EXTRACT, and INTERSECT queries' status depends on the final execution
status of both the left and right SELECT statements. If both statements are L, the
combined statement is L. If both statements are P, and the query is a UNION ALL
the combined statement is P. For any other combination, the resulting status is S.
</p>

<h4>Acquisition of the final execution status of SELECT</h4>
<p>
If everything in the SELECT has a status of L, then the final execution status
is L. The same rule applies for P. For any other combination, the final status is S.
If the status is L, the load is distributed among nodes when loadbalance_mode is
true and sent to the MASTER if false. For P, parallel processing is done with
the parallel execution engine. For S, the query rewriting presented below is done.
</p>

<h3 id="step_rewrite_query">Query rewriting</h3>
<p>
The Query is rewritten by using the execution status acquired while analyzing
the query.
Here is an example. The P1-table has the P status, the L1-table has the L status.
</p>
<pre>
SELECT P1-table.col, L1-table.col
FROM P1-table,L1-table
where P1-table.col = L1-table.col
order by P1-table.col;
</pre>

<p>
In this query, because there is an ORDER BY clause, the status is S.
The FROM clause, the WHERE clause, and TARGETLIST are in the P status.
The query is rewritten into something like this :
</p>

<pre>
SELECT P1-table.col, L1-table.col FROM
    dblink(select pool_parallel(SELECT P1-table.col, L1-table.col FROM P1-table,L1-table where P1-table.col = L1-table.col))
      order by P1-table.col;
</pre>
<p>
dblink transmits the query to pgpool-II here.
the pool_parallel function is responsible for sending the query to the
parallel execution engine.
</p>
<p>In this example, the FROM and WHERE clause, and the TARGETLIST are run in
parallel mode. This isn't the real rewritten query, just something for the sake
of providing an example.
</p>
<p>
Here is another case:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT L1-table.col FROM L1-table WHERE L1-table.col % 2 = 0 AND L1-table.col IN (SELECT P1-table FROM P1-table) ;
</pre>

<p>
In this example, the FROM and WHERE clause and the TARGETLIST are in the L
status. Because the subquery is in the P status, the query itself is in the S status.
The rewriting is, as a consequence, performed as follows.
</p>
<pre>
SELECT L1-table.col
  FROM dblink(SELECT loadbalance(SELECT L1-table.col
              FROM L1-table
              WHERE L1-table.col % 2 = 0
                AND TRUE))
    WHERE
        L1-table.col %2 = 0 AND
      L1-table.col IN
      (
          SELECT P1-Table FROM
          dblink(select pool_parallel(SELECT P1-table FROM P1-table))
      ) ;
</pre>
<p>
pool_loadbalance is a function responsible for dispatching queries to either node.
</p>

<h3>Query rewriting for aggregate functions</h3>
<p>
For grouping queries (aggregate functions and GROUP BY), rewriting tries to
reduce the load on the system DB by performing a first aggregate on each node.
</p>
<p>
First, let's see what pgpool-II does for rewriting.
</p>
<p>
This query has the P status in the FROM clause and count(*) in TARGETLIST.
So the rewriting is done as follows.
</p>
<pre>
  select count(*) from P1-table;

    -&gt; rewrite

    SELECT
        sum(pool_c$1) as count
    FROM
        dblink(select pool_parallel('select count(*) from  P1-table'))
                    AS pool_$1g (pool_c$1 bigint);
</pre>
<p>
Query rewriting like above is done in these conditions.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The FROM clause is in the P status.</li>
    <li>The column specified in the aggregate function (only count, sum, min,
        max, and avg) and GROUP BY is used in the target list.</li>
    <li>The WHERE clause is in the P status.</li>
    <li>Only the columns defined by the aggregate function (only count, sum,
        min, max, and avg), used in the HAVING clause and the FROM clause, and
        the column specified for GROUP BY are used.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="caution_in_parallel_mode">Notes on the parallel mode</h3>
<p>
The column names and types are needed when a query is analyzed in parallel mode.
Therefore, when an expression or a function is used in the TARGETLIST of
a subquery, the alias and type (through a cast) are needed. Please note that
if no cast is provided in an expression or a function, the text type will be
chosen as a default. For count(), bigint type is assumed, and for sum(),
numeric. For min()/max(), if the argument is a date type, returned datatype is date,
else, it is assumed numeric. avg() is processed as sum()/count() (sum divided by count).

<h3 id="performance_parallel_mode">About the performance of a parallel mode</h3>
<p>Here is a rough estimate of the query performance versus execution status:
</p>

<table border>
<tr class="header"><th>Execution status</th><th>Performance</th></tr>
<tr><th>L</th>
<td>There is no performance deterioration with a single node,
    excluding the overhead of pgpool-II, because there is no parallel querying done at all.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>P</th>
<td>Parallel processing is fast, especially the sequential scans.
    It's easy to get speedups because the scan of a big table becomes the parallel scan
    of much smaller ones by being distributed on several nodes.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>S</th>
<td>When aggregate functions can be rewritten in a parallel fashion, they are fast.
</td></tr>
