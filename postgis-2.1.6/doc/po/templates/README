This directory contains the template files to use for starting
a translation of the PostGIS manual.

To start your own language add its code to the ``translations``
variable in POSTGIS/doc/Makefile.in, re-run ./configure and
then run ``make update-po``. The rule will take care of creating
the initial .po files under POSTGIS/doc/po/<language_code>/, you
can then add those files to the repository and send the whole
(Makefile.in changes and new .po files) as a patch or pull request.
